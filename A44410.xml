         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>I Am not unſenſible, that a Diſcourſe, concerning <hi>Lent,</hi> which declares not againſt it, may be apt to be ſuſpected at firſt ſight, of a very Ill, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, Deſign; either of retrieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Antiquated Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or of bringing back upon the World ſome old Rigours and Auſterities, from which they have been happily ſet Free.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Title Page,</hi> or at leaſt the Summary of the <hi>Contents,</hi> may, I hope, eaſe the Reader of that Jealouſy: and if he will bear but the Penance, of peruſing the Treatiſe; he will find, that the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Part aims only at Truth
<pb facs="tcp:46380:3"/>in matter of Fact; and that ſuch an <hi>Origination</hi> is offer'd, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complies with the Romiſh Errors, nor induces any other Reſtraints, than what he, in the Liberty of his own Diſcretion, ſhall think fit to Injoin himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Derivation of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Lent,</hi> from a like Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Time of the Jews, has ſeem'd to me to be very Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a long while: and having intimated ſo much of it in a late Royal Audience, as ſerv'd to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and to Direct, to the Duty of the Seaſon; I was eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to conſider it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, in ſome, as I then thought, ſhort Diſcourſe, but which by degrees has increas'd to a greater bulk.</p>
                  <p>For preſently it appear'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the better Adjuſting
<pb facs="tcp:46380:3"/>this Parallel Line, as it were, of Jewiſh Practice; that I ſhould firſt diſtinctly view that of the Chriſtian; tracing it from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by the Elder Accounts; and Aſcertaining it, as I went, with what exactneſs I might. And here, the differing Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of, the juſtly Celebrated, Monſieur <hi>Daille</hi> meeting me in in my Progreſs, oblig'd me, to ſtay longer on ſome Places; and to clear the Ground, of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections he had thrown in the Way.</p>
                  <p>And then, when this Work was diſpatcht; and there ſeem'd to remain no more, than that I ſhould bring forth the Reaſon, and Uſages, of the Jewiſh <hi>Lent,</hi> and propoſe its Agreement and Affinity with ours: it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judg'd Requiſite, leſt this
<pb facs="tcp:46380:4"/>ſingle Similitude ſhould be thought only Caſual; to ſhew, that there were, in the Chriſtian Religion, many other like Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies, which muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently be attributed to the ſame Original.</p>
                  <p>This therefore chiefly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd that Addition to the ſecond Part, which makes the firſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partition:</hi> and finding the ſubject to be copious, I enlarg'd the more willingly upon it; not only to ſerve my firſt Intention the more effectually; but to try, if by this means ſome more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable account might not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of many an Antient, and now Uncouth, Chriſtian Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For, though of late many very Learned Men of our own, and Foreign Nations, have much illuſtrated the New Teſtament
<pb facs="tcp:46380:4"/>by ſuch Comparative Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet their Curioſity has not happen'd to carry them ſo far, as to hold their Jewiſh Light to the dark Corners of our Unſcriptural Antiquity. A Task, I heartily wiſh ſuch a one, as our Able Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> had undertook: if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might have ſav'd me the Hazard I now run, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make Other things underſtood, by the help of what I underſtand ſo little.</p>
                  <p>But concerning theſe elder Unſcriptural Cuſtoms, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is deſir'd to obſerve, that I intend not to Recommend them, by the Original I indeavour to Aſſign: my Attempt deſigning nothing more, than to propoſe the Fact, and Conjecture at its Riſe; a Curioſity allowed in all ſearches after Antiquities, of any
<pb facs="tcp:46380:5"/>kind; and commonly receiv'd by the Learned World with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. For as the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us<note n="*" place="margin">Jerem. 6.16.</note>, to <hi>ſtand in the Ways,</hi> for our Direction; and <hi>ſee, and ask for the Old Paths, that we may walk therein:</hi> ſo we may alſo <hi>ſtand</hi> a little, and <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd <hi>Paths,</hi> though we are to leave them; as we view the Old, Forſaken, <hi>Foſſeways;</hi> looking about, for our Delight, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>For, if the Derivations I offer at, ſhould have the good fortune to Obtain; there will be no worſe Conſequences than theſe: On one hand, That ſuch Rites were not ſo much borrowed from Heatheniſm; nor otherwiſe contriv'd, and ſuper-induc'd, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Age; as ſome have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted:
<pb facs="tcp:46380:5"/>and on the other hand that though they might be as old as the Apoſtles, and have had the honour to be practis'd by them; yet they were not then newly Erected, and purpoſely Inſtituted, as the Popiſh Authors would perſwade us; nor all of them Recommended, much leſs given in Precept, to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>But the Obligation, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs, Expedience, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, of their Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is a conſideration of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind; to be judged by the Nature of the Reſpective Rites; by the Intimated, or Preſum'd, Intention of the Apoſtles; and by the Declaration of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Apoſtolical Church. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not therefore to Intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in it; nor undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether ſome of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:46380:6"/>Cuſtoms, though deſign'd, as they ſay, for a more Honourable Interment, were not however kept too long; or whether ſome have not been ſince Buried, that were never Dead: profeſſing, in this whole matter, to adhere ſtill to the Judgment of our Church; whoſe Prudent and Pious Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if I may ſpeak from my own Experience, the further any one ſhall Conſider, the more he will ſee cauſe to Approve.</p>
                  <p>This Allowance for the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Intention, the Juſtice, I hope, of the Reader will not deny me: but I ſhall never the leſs want the Pardon ſtill, both of the Learn'd, and Unlearn'd. For, though I have endeavour'd, what I could, to make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe Plain, and Intelligible; and have therefore rid it of all
<pb facs="tcp:46380:6"/>ſtrange Languages, and their Criticiſms, ſetting them aſide, and by themſelves; yet the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it ſelf may in ſome places be ſtrange, and nice, to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted; and require a little better Attention. And ſo, though I deſign'd to ſhun being Tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, eſpecially in matters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known; and would have been glad, elſewhere to have avoided Miſtakes: yet, I know, I am much at the Mercy of the Learn'd; as I ſhall be always ready to be inſtructed by their Corrections.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. I.

                     <p n="2">§. II. AND if there has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſuch a <hi>Weekly Memorial</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> we ſhall little doubt but it had too an <hi>Yearly Solemnity.</hi> It is true, there is not ſo early a mention of that <hi>Annual Feſtival,</hi> (neither is it likely, that there ſhould have been as much occaſion for the Remembrance of what happened but once a Year, as of that which was done every Week:) but neither has there been wanting ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Evidence for its great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

                     <p>About the Time of the <hi>Weekly Feaſt,</hi> the <hi>Firſt Day;</hi> there could be no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement: but about the <hi>Annual</hi> there might be very much.

                     <p n="3">§. III. THE moſt likely Queſtion to happen, concerning the Place of the <hi>Yearly Reſurrection-Day,</hi> [whether it ſhould be always kept on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> or no,] was the great Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Churches of Leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and in which all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ingag'd: a Diſpute managed by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46380:16"/>the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> too warmly, but which has done ſo much good, as to give occaſion for the preſerving ſome Records relating to this part of the Hiſtory of Chriſtianity, by which we are certainly inform'd of the Great and Univerſal Antiquity of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and its preceding <hi>Fast.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches, beſides their ſingularity in breaking off their <hi>Fast</hi> on the 14th, day, celebrated the Solemnity of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> on a fixt day of the <hi>first Month</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whatever day of the <hi>Week</hi> it prov'd to be: and the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> if it happened not to be a <hi>Sunday,</hi> obſerved it on ſome <hi>Sunday</hi> near it. But both the Parties kept the <hi>Feſtival,</hi> and each of them contended, That it had been ſo kept in their ſeveral Churches from their firſt Plantation.</p>
                     <p>For about this Matter, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſeveral Biſhops of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> met in their ſeveral Synods; and all of them, except thoſe of <hi>Aſia, properly ſo called,</hi> agreed on theſe two Points, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to them from Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46380:16"/>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Solemnity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was not to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated on any other day, but the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that the <hi>Paſchal Faſt</hi> ought not to be ended till that Day.</p>
                     <p>This was the Anſwer of all thoſe Synods, to the Queſtions in difference: and the Returns of many of them are mentioned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> to have been extant in his time <hi>(g).</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The general Reſult of thoſe Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Determinations, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives us, is ſufficient to ſatisfie us, That the Biſhops of both ſides were fully poſſeſs'd of the Apoſtolical Tradition of their different Cuſtoms of obſerving <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And ſuch an uniform Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſo many venerable Perſons, from ſuch diſtant Places, about ſuch a ſolemn and obſervable a Practice, and at a time no more remote from the Age of the Apoſtles, cannot but induce us to give credit to this their ſingle Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as it is by him Authentically reported. For as to the time of this Diſpute, it is well judg'd to have been agitated about the Year 190 of our Lord's <hi>Birth,</hi> not 160 after his <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> the <hi>Memorial</hi> of which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46380:17"/>we now ſpeak of; not much above 120 Years from the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor above 90 after the Death of St. <hi>John.</hi>

                     <p n="4">§. IV. GREAT Regard is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be had to the Judgement of the whole <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> of that time, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſummarily reports to us <hi>(g),</hi> of their Tradition concerning <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Had indeed the ſeveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, the Biſhops of the Provinces ſent, remain'd to our days, or had <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> given us more Extracts of them; we could not have fail'd of many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Particularities, alledged by them, in Favour and Juſtification of this general Aſſertion. But they are all loſt: neither was it agreeable to that <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>'s purpoſe, to fill his Books with Proofs for the Antiquity of this Solemnity, a Matter in his days never doubted by any. For which Reaſon, neither does he give us out of them any Inſtances in Confirmation of that particular Uſage, in which the great part of the World agreed with <hi>Victor,</hi> and which afterwards general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail'd: He rather thought fit, at a time when the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Cuſtom was

                     <p>Here then we have <hi>Polycarp</hi> a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. <hi>John,</hi> atteſting to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Tradition, an undeniable Witneſs of its Apoſtolical Antiquity. We know too that this Diſcourſe of his with <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus</hi> muſt be at fartheſt in the year 161, if we reckon <hi>Anicetus</hi> his Death, with Biſhop <hi>Pearſon;</hi> and in the year 153, if with Mr. <hi>Dodwell;</hi> between 30 and 40 years before this Diſpute of <hi>Victor</hi>'s. And indeed it ſeems plain from the ſame piece of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Letter, that this Difference had been taken notice of almoſt from St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, though mutually tolerated. For to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he mentions the behaviour of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus, Pius, Hyginus, Teleſphorus, Xy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> all Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> up to the year of our Lord 101 by Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> 102 by Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> very near the time of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Deceaſe.</p>
                     <p>From all which we ſee not only what good Authority the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with <hi>Victor,</hi> had for their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: but that this matter had been long before brought into Queſtion; and made ſo remarkable very early, that thoſe of both ſides, muſt have had ſome diſtinct, and more than general remembrance of the ſucceſſive Practice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46380:20"/>of their ſeveral Cuſtoms convey'd down to them. Neither indeed could thoſe of <hi>Victor</hi>'s Judgment have ever oppos'd the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Obſervation, whoſe Antiquity was ſo well prov'd; if they had not produc'd on their ſide as good Evidence for their own: ſuch Evidence, I ſay, as they might well be furniſht with, from the elder Memorials of the ſame debate.</p>
                     <p>And thus did both ſides of this Great Diſpute, however they differ'd in the particular manner of their Paſchal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, abſolutely agree in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, concerning the Apoſtolical Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it. A little while after this time, <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> wrote a <hi>Treatiſe concerning the Paſchal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and ſome <hi>Diſſertations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faſting,</hi> all which are loſt.

                     <p>Such expreſs Accounts of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Seaſon, there have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, very near the Apoſtles times; which, had they been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, might have more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us: ſerving however to let us know in groſs, That the Solemnity was not then held an inconſiderable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but all along much debated, and ſtudied, and determined with great Exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole Matter therefore we have ſeen, that as we had ſome reaſon to preſume the Apoſtolical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a <hi>Yearly,</hi> from the <hi>Weekly</hi> day of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> ſo this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Probability is beſides actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

                     <p>Theſe are the ſeveral Kinds of <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> a Duty all along obſerved by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Men, and acceptable to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both Teſtaments; whether as it was helpful to their Devotion, or as it became a part of it. It was helpful,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46380:24"/>as it ſerved medicinally to reſtrain the looſer Appetites of the Fleſh, and to keep the Body under; and as it gave Liberty and Ability to the Mind, to Reflect, and Conſider, and Attend, either while they were actually aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Divine Service,</hi> or preparing for ſome ſolemn part of It.

                     </p>
                     <p>That which I ſhall firſt mention, was the <hi>Faſt</hi> of a <hi>Penitent;</hi> one who had committed after Baptiſm ſome grievous Sin, and was excluded from the Aſſembly, either by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or by Publick Sentence; and deſired to be reconciled to God and the Church. The Courſe of this their ſecond Repentance, was much more ſevere than of that before their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; it appeared ſo upon the ſight of them, as they are deſcribed by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> (then a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and about the Year 200). <hi>(q) Neither Waſhed nor Trimmed, Neglected and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean; taking no Delight in any thing; living in the Roughneſs of Sackcloth, and the Filth and Harſhneſs of Aſhes; their Faces diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured with Faſting.</hi> For the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> they were under directed them (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46380:25"/>he tells us at large, in his manner of Style <hi>(r),</hi>) <hi>To lye in Sackcloth and Aſhes; to disfigure their Body with a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, and to deject their Mind with Grief: All the while to uſe no other Meat or Drink,</hi> but <hi>what is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and natural,</hi> [Bread and Water]; <hi>not to ſatisfie the Appetite, but to keep up Life: and frequently to nouriſh and ſtrengthen their Prayers with</hi> [ſtrict] <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to Groan, to Weep, to Roar to the Lord their God, day and night; to fall down at the feet of the Presbyters, to kneel to the Friends of God, and to beg of all the Brotherhood to intercede for them.</hi> Such was the rigorous Penance of lapſed Chriſtians, and their Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly an <hi>Affliction of their Souls,</hi> as it is termed in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Another</hi> ſolemn <hi>Occaſion</hi> of <hi>Faſting</hi> was the Profeſſion of Repentance thoſe made who were converted to the Faith, and preparing to be Baptized. Before the Reception of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was not only the Practice of the Candidates to Faſt, but of the whole Congregation with them: as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his admirable <hi>Apology</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46380:25"/>has inform'd the Emperour and us. He is ſuppoſed by Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> to have wrote no later than the Year 138; and there, after he had given an account of our Faith, he adds this Relation. <hi>(s) As many as are perſwaded, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that theſe things taught and ſaid by us are true, and promiſe to be able to live accordingly; they are instructed to Pray, and, with Faſting, to beg of God Remiſſion of their Sins, we Praying and Faſting together with them. Then they are brought by us to the Place where Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, and are regenerated in the ſame manner of Regeneration wherewith we were regenerated before. For, in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Such a <hi>Common Faſt</hi> there was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently at the Adminiſtration of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that it could not be the work of every day of their Aſſembling, but muſt have had ſome ſet time: as we know the moſt ſolemn time was on <hi>Eaſter-Day;</hi> thoſe who were baptized into his Death, then as it were riſing up with him: The whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having Faſted together with them before, not only upon that particular Reaſon, but upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46380:26"/>Account, as we ſhall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee.</p>
                     <p>And though the <hi>Fast</hi> and <hi>Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the other Penitent, was proper to his Perſon, and to be undertaken at any time whenſoever he was ſenſible of his Offence: yet there might too have been ſome more ſolemn time, even for this Duty; whether the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were injoin'd upon a notorious Sinner, or ſomething of it voluntarily undergone by a more ſecret Offender. And no time could be more fit for this purpoſe, than that in which the whole Congregation would join together in Prayer and Faſting, for themſelves and them: ſuch a time as the Seaſon before <hi>Eaſter</hi> was, in which all prepar'd more worthily to receive, and ſome therefore ſtrove to be again thought worthy in any degree to receive, the ſolemn Communion of that Great Day.</p>
                     <p>Thus did the Faſting on both thoſe occaſions, frequently take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to cloſe in with the <hi>Faſt</hi> before <hi>Easter:</hi> an Obſervation I now only mention incidentally, deſigning no more by the early Practice of theſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46380:26"/>two occaſional <hi>Faſts,</hi> the one Publick, and the other both Publick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; than to prepare the Reader the eaſier to admit the great Antiquity of this both Publick and Univerſal <hi>Fast,</hi> which we are now coming particularly to conſider.</p>

                     <p>Differences, we ſee, will ſtill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon this Subject: for neither is the World at an Agreement about the Meaning of this Place. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it be no great wonder, that the ſence of ſuch a conciſe Fragment ſhould be a little uncertain; where we have no help, from what went before, or came after, to determine it. I have therefore given a double Rendring of the doubtful Paſſage; One marked with the Letter A, according to <hi>Valeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> which is embraced by <hi>Daillé,</hi> and thoſe who have a mind to depreſs the Antiquity of <hi>Lent,</hi> and eſpecially of the <hi>forty Days:</hi> and another marked with B, much according to <hi>Ruſſinus</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:46380:30"/>his Verſion, made about the End of the fourth Century.</p>
                     <p>And, to begin with what concerns the <hi>Fast</hi> in general, it can never be ſuppoſed, though ſome would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſhould, That <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in the laſt of the two doubtful Paſſages how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rendered, ſpeaks any thing to the Diſparagement of the <hi>Faſt</hi> it ſelf: as if thoſe who long before his time had Governed the Church leſs exactly, had ſhew'd their leſs Exactneſs in the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a <hi>Lent.</hi> Had He ſaid ſo, he had indeed effectually ſilenc'd one part of the Grand Diſpute, that concerning the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Fast;</hi> for he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt any Faſt at all: but he muſt have been taken then for an ill Arbitrator by <hi>Victor</hi> and the reſt, as well as by <hi>Polycrates,</hi> who all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined in the Tradition of the <hi>Faſt;</hi> and muſt of neceſſity, by the change of the Queſtion, have become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adverſary and turned the whole Diſpute upon himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But this Great Man uſed another method, and went by the common Principle. For he ſpeaks to <hi>Victor</hi> of the Practice of thoſe of his own ſide;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46380:30"/>who differed from the common Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, but with whom Communion had been always held, and was not now refuſed by <hi>Victor</hi> himſelf. Some of thoſe Differences, it is plain, he charges with leſs Exactneſs; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon the Authors of them, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, but not upon <hi>Victor</hi>'s Predeceſſors or his own: and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument then for Peace proceeds thus with great force, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not break off Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> for their different manner; for thoſe who joined with him againſt them, and remained in his Communion, had their different Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms too.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore no Reflection from this place upon the Original of <hi>Lent:</hi> but, on the contrary, there is a ſtrong Confirmation of its Apoſtolical Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity under either Verſion. For thoſe who (according to <hi>Valeſius) Governed the Churches</hi> with that little Exactneſs, as to be Authors of an undue Cuſtom, were very <hi>Ancient, long before the days</hi> of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and are ſuppoſed here to have had Cotemporaries, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the right Manner. But further,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46380:31"/>in the other, I think, more exact In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, thoſe who <hi>were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Irenaeus <hi>his time,</hi> and conſequently very near to the time of St. <hi>John,</hi> are ſaid expreſly to have been, (though not faithful and exact, yet) <hi>Retainers and Keepers</hi> of a Cuſtom, which had therefore been rightly practiſed yet earlier, even before the days of thoſe, who were <hi>long before Irenaeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. Thus much concerning the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of a <hi>Lent,</hi> I could not omit to add, from theſe few Lines of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaus,</hi> caſually preſerved to us, and which ſpeak very caſually to that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: To the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Keeping Lent</hi> they are more expreſs and direct; but very brief and conciſe, as wrote on another deſign, and not for <hi>Victor</hi>'s or our Information in the Particular we deſire to ſee.</p>

                     <p>As to the <hi>Two or More days,</hi> it is not neither determined after what ſort they were kept: whether in One con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Faſt</hi> uninterrupted by any Food, as <hi>two or more</hi> of thoſe days were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly faſted by ſome of the next Age, eſpecially in the <hi>Paſſion-Week;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Faſts</hi> were ſeveral, though the <hi>Days</hi> were continued, each Day ended with ſome Refreſhment.

                     <p>Hitherto the Words are plain, and of certain Conſtruction; though we may not know every particular Caſe to which they might refer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>It is not abſolutely neceſſary to any deſign of theſe Papers, That <hi>forty Days</hi> ſhould be here named expreſly: for they may well be admitted under the latitude of the word <hi>More,</hi> if we ſhall hereafter ſee Reaſon to underſtand them ſo early. I hope therefore I am not partial, when I judge the Old Tranſlation of this Place, to be prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Modern.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> a Day of 40 Hours, is a ſpace of time never before heard of; neither determined by the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,

And if we ſhould admit of ſuch a ſingle Day, meaſured not by the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Motion, but by our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s lying in the Grave; yet it would be ſtrange to join <hi>two or more</hi> of thoſe days together. <hi>Valeſius,</hi> therefore wonders, That the Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has been endured, and that no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has ſeen, that the <hi>Greek</hi> word for <hi>Day</hi> muſt be changed into that for <hi>Fast,</hi> and the Sentence run ſo. <hi>Some meaſure their</hi> Faſt <hi>by</hi> 40 <hi>Hours,</hi> &amp;c. This Change he is forced to by the Senſe, not countenanced by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Copy. But not to object the Odneſs of this <hi>Faſt,</hi> that was to begin at ſooneſt after Breakfaſt on the <hi>Friday,</hi> and which took notice of our Lord's Burial, but not of his Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſs of his previous Sufferings and Apprehenſion; to paſs this over, for this might be one of thoſe leſs exact Manners, which once had place, though afterwards left off: yet ſtill the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hours of Day and Night</hi> would be very redundant, eſpecially where the Author is ſo Brief; for what need is there of this Circumſtantial Deſcription? and how could Forty Hours have otherwiſe come together?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his Verſion is thus, <hi>(e) And ſome Forty</hi> [Days]: <hi>ſo that they make the Day, by Computation of Hours of Day and Night.</hi> And if the Place be underſtood as commonly it is, and there be no more meant by it, than that the One or More days before ſpoke of, were the Civil or Periodical Days, and conſiſted each of 24 Hours; yet the Inconvenience <hi>Valeſius</hi> urges will not follow; and a <hi>Faſt</hi> of Forty ſuch Days will not exclude, we know, ſo much Refreſhment every Evening as may ſupport Nature. The greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity I can find in that Acception
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46380:33"/>of the Words, is, That it makes <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> on a Subject he does but touch, to give <hi>Victor</hi> unneceſſarily a verboſe Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Day, one and the ſame thing; where the only Intention was to put him in remembrance of a Variety. I ſhould rather therefore think, That when he had given a ſhort Account of the different Numbers of Days, he ſhould then add a ſhort mention of the different Quantities of a Day: That ſome computed the day <hi>Vulgarly,</hi> by the Appearance of the <hi>Sun;</hi> and ſome <hi>Civilly,</hi> by its Revolution. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Deſign of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected one of the Tranſlations above, to which this of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> will agree.</p>
                     <p>Neither will it, I ſuppoſe, be very material to object, That a <hi>Faſt</hi> only from <hi>Sun-Riſing</hi> to <hi>Sun-Set,</hi> has not been uſual ſince among Chriſtians: for it might have been practiſed then, though diſus'd afterwards as leſs exact; and (as we have ſeen) the <hi>Jews</hi> have all along faſted in that manner upon moſt Occaſions, and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> continually do. Neither will it be wondered, That ſo known a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as that of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutional</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:46380:34"/>Day, ſhould have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo negligently in few Words. And as for any other leſſer Criticiſm <hi>(c),</hi> it may eaſily be ſatisfied for, if only by the natural force of the Sence, and its appoſite ſuitableneſs to the Scope of the Place.</p>
                     <p>And thus far have we learned from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> That the <hi>Obſervation of Lent</hi> was very <hi>Ancient:</hi> and that its <hi>Fast</hi> then conſiſted not of <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Two days,</hi> but <hi>More;</hi> and in ſome Places, very probably of <hi>Forty.</hi>

Of theſe Days <hi>Friday</hi> was apparently choſe for one, becauſe on it our Saviour had ſuffered; and <hi>Wedneſday</hi> is ſaid to be the other, becauſe he had been then ſold to the High Prieſts: and further, we cannot but think, that theſe which were kept in ſome manner every Week, in the Memory of our Lord's <hi>Paſſion,</hi> ſhould, in the <hi>Paſſion-Week</hi> it ſelf, have been kept with great Solemnity.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. II.

                        <hi>Montanus,</hi> whom our Author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily followed, is ſuppoſed to have begun his New Doctrine about the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46380:36"/>Year 172. He is ſaid not to have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Catholicks in the main Articles of Faith <hi>(e),</hi> (though ſome of them were accuſed of <hi>Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm (f),</hi> but only in ſome Rigours of Practice, which he enjoyn'd as by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command. He abſolutely forbad all ſecond Marriages: condemn'd all declining of Danger in time of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: made the Abſtinence of the ordinary Stations to be longer, and more ſevere, diſmiſſing their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies later, and allowing then a very ſpare Refreſhment.

                     <p>Of this Sect was <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a Man of an auſtere Life, and rigid Temper, and a fierce Diſputer: but excellently Learn'd, and after his peculiar faſhion very Eloquent. His Book concerning <hi>Faſting</hi> happens to be preſerv'd; where in Juſtification of his own Party, he ſumms up the Opinion and the Practice of his Adverſaries, the Catholicks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Matter. <hi>(m) They accuſe us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that we keep Faſts of our own; that for the moſt part we prolong the time of our Stations to the Evening; and that we uſe the Dry Diet, feeding on no Fleſh nor Broth, nor any Juicy Fruit, neither Eating nor Drinking any thing that is Vinous: and that beſides we then abſtain from Bathing, an Abſtinence conſequent to ſuch a Dry Food. This they object to us
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46380:37"/>for an Innovation, and conclude it to be unlawful; either to be judg'd Heretical, if it be a Humane Doctrine; or to be condemn'd for falſe Prophecy, if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be an Ordinance of the Spirit. So that we are either way to be</hi> Accus'd, <hi>as thoſe who</hi> preach another Goſpel. <hi>For as to Faſts, they tell us, That certain Days have been appointed by God.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is his Repreſentation of the Catholicks Thoughts, concerning the <hi>Ante-Paſchal</hi> Faſt, from which he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in the 13th Chapter. <hi>(n) You plead,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the Chriſtian Faith hath its Solemnities already determined by Scripture or Tradition; and that no other Obſervation is to be ſuper-added, becauſe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs of Innovation. Keep to that ground if you can; for here I find
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46380:38"/>you your ſelves both faſting out of the Paſchal Seaſon, beſides thoſe days in which the</hi> Bridegroom <hi>was</hi> taken away: <hi>and alſo interpoſing the Half-faſts of your Stations, and ſometimes too living on Bread only and Water, as every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon thinks fit. You anſwer indeed that theſe things are done at your Liberty, and not by Command: but then you have quitted your Ground, and gone beyond your Tradition, when you do ſuch things as have not been appointed you.</hi> And ſo in the next Chapter <hi>(o),</hi> in anſwer to thoſe who compar'd them to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> as Obſervers of <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Months,</hi> he replies; That <hi>they obſerve not the Jewiſh Ceremonies: but that to the New Teſtament there belong new Solemnities.

We offer to our Lord two Weeks of Dry Diet, and thoſe not whole Weeks neither,</hi> Saturdays <hi>and</hi> Sundays <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exempted; abſtaining then from ſuch Food, which we do not reject, but only defer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe Teſtimonies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of this Book, we may ſubjoin ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his Diſſertation about Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>(s)</hi> Where after he has explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and ſpoke of ſome Requiſites to Prayer, he then comes to cenſure ſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſervances about it, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly taxes a Cuſtom that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prevail: Thoſe who were in a Faſt, towards the Concluſion of their Aſſemblies, and juſt before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46380:39"/>not ſaluting their <hi>Brethren with the Holy Kiſs,</hi> then always us'd on that occaſion. This declining to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute had been the Faſhion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Faſts, as a ſign of Sorrow: and is reprov'd here by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in Chriſtians, as being a kind of Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Faſting, and contrary therefore to the Direction of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which commands us <hi>not to appear to men to faſt. For now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we are known to faſt by abſtaining from that Salutation. But if there be any reaſon for ſuch a Cuſtom, you may at your own home if you pleaſe, and among your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, from whom your faſting cannot well be concealed, defer that Ceremony of Peace: but otherwiſe where-ever you may conceal your Faſt, you are to remember the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and by this means you will both keep your Rule abroad, and your Cuſtom at home. For ſo on</hi> Good Friday, <hi>when the Devotion of Faſting is Common, and as it were Publick; we juſtly forbear the Salutation; taking no care to conceal from the reſt, what is done together by us all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. NOW from theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> it appears, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Religious Aſſemblies, or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46380:40"/>of <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> were now well known and practiſed in the Chriſtian Church, and generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have deſcended from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; as recommended by their example to the devouter Chriſtians, and not as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the whole Body by any Precept.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conſtant Opinion of the Catholicks of his time preſum'd, That <hi>thoſe days in which the Bridegroom, our Saviour, was taken away,</hi> were to be faſted not at Pleaſure, but by Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; being deſign'd and determin'd to that Duty from the Beginning. This is certainly the Catholick Sence; as it is repreſented by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſecond Chapter in expreſs words, where he ſpeaks both of the Deſignation of our Saviour, and the Obſervation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and as it is again intimated by him in the 13th. Nor could it have been brought in queſtion by Mr. <hi>Daillé,</hi> had he not ſtudied his own <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> too much.</p>
                     <p>Neither is that judgment of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, concerning thoſe days, any ways diſparaged by the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they give there to our Saviour's Words<note n="(t)" place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.15.</note> For though this Saying of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46380:40"/>his may be well underſtood at large, as it is by moſt Commentators, of thoſe Diſtreſſes and Afflictions the Diſciples ſhould fall under upon his Departure; the very mention of which they could not now bear: vet it will too very properly admit the other Meaning, and particularly imply ſome ſtated Days of Faſting, hereafter to be obſerved by them: and which our Saviour here predicts at leaſt, if not directs. They were priviledged now, by their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> from the ordinary <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> Faſts of the ſtricter <hi>Jews;</hi> or from others extraordinary ſet up by <hi>John:</hi> but when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſhould be <hi>taken away,</hi> that Exemption, he tells them, would ceaſe; and, withal, new Cauſe of Faſting would ariſe, and new times be appointed. And then he adds, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Figures of <hi>a Garment,</hi> and of <hi>Bottles of Wine;</hi> That neither would thoſe Faſts of his new Inſtitution be proper as yet, under the old Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither were his Diſciples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared now to undertake and obſerve them: but that hereafter, when all things ſhould be new, his New Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46380:41"/>ſhould have New Faſts of its own; and his Diſciples too become for them New Men, by the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. This Expoſition of the Text, concerning ſuch new Faſts in general, after our Saviour's Death, ſeems to be moſt natural; very apt, I am ſure, it is to the Occaſion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, of that Saying. And if then thoſe general Words were by the firſt Chriſtians applied in particular, to that very time of the Year in which He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and on which they faſted, as by Apoſtolical Tradition; it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For ſuch ſecondary Applications of Scripture, to Subjects not ſeeming at firſt ſight to have been intended by it, is very uſual in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is the known manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to accommodate the words of the Bible to ſuch Practices as they take to be of Divine Authority, though they are hinted only and alluded to there, not expreſſed, much leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, Thoſe Days</hi> which were to be ſo faſted, are twice expreſly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Plural Number. And of <hi>Thoſe</hi> Two are obvious, the <hi>Friday</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46380:41"/>the <hi>Saturday,</hi> in which he was Taken, Crucified, and Buried. Theſe at leaſt, muſt, I think, be underſtood by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s Catholicks: neither has he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any where any contrary Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in the 14th Chapter of his Treatiſe of <hi>Faſting,</hi> the <hi>Saturday</hi> ſaid there to be faſted ſometimes, is, in all probability, not the Holy <hi>Saturday,</hi> but any other <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Year. <hi>(p)</hi> And in his Book of <hi>Prayer, Good-Friday</hi> is mentioned peculiarly, not ſimply, for its being a Common <hi>Faſt-Day;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a Faſt-Day in which there was the uſual Opportunity for the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kiſs,</hi> and in which it was omitted. Whereas on the <hi>Saturday</hi> they Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled late, and ſpent the Evening in Baptizing the <hi>Catechumens:</hi> and that Day having in its Office no Place for that Ceremony, conſequently gave not our Author the ſame occaſion to ſpeak of it. And thus much ſeems evident concerning <hi>Two of Thoſe Days.</hi> But they were reckoned by others, as we have obſerved before, from <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> and by ſome from <hi>Monday,</hi> the Fifth day before the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> the day of the Caption of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> ordered

                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Exod. 12.3.</note>: in conformity to which they ſuppos'd our <hi>Saviour</hi> to have been at that time ſingled out, as it were, by the <hi>High-Prieſts,</hi> and determined for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. This is certain, That, by many, all thoſe Days were particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; as we ſhall preſently know from an Author but <hi>fifty</hi> Years young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: who is indeed the firſt that tells us of ſuch a Practice; but, as we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten intimate, muſt not therefore be ſuppoſed the firſt that knew it done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of <hi>Thoſe Days</hi> the <hi>Friday</hi> was the moſt remarkable: for in that He was <hi>taken away</hi> actually; Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, Cruciſied, and laid in the Grave; and accordingly It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept with a ſingular Devotion by the whole Church: the latter half of the Night (in which the Apoſtles ſhould heretofore have watch'd) in Watching, and the Day too in Faſting and Praying. And for this Reaſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we need not have wondered if <hi>Good-Friday</hi> had been particularly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 14th Chapter of <hi>Faſting,</hi> as it is in the Treatiſe of <hi>Prayer.</hi> I confeſs from ſome words of the laſt Mr. <hi>Daillè</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:46380:42"/>would infer, That <hi>Good-Friday</hi> was not then obſerved by all Chriſtians: becauſe the Devotion of that Day is ſaid to be <hi>Common, and as it were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> or, as he ſometimes underſtands, <hi>almoſt Publick.</hi> And his Obſervation would have been true, had <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid <hi>as it were</hi> or <hi>almost Common:</hi> but when it is firſt term'd <hi>Common,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reſtriction, and after too ſaid <hi>to be kept by All;</hi> that Conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhould have lead that very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon to the true Meaning of this Phraſe, <hi>as it were Publick.</hi> For <hi>Publick,</hi> he knew, does not only ſignifie what belongs to all; but what is expos'd, or appears to all: which laſt Sence, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Hiding</hi> and <hi>Concealing,</hi> the Scope of the place evidently requires. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is plain, why <hi>Tertullian</hi> puts in his <hi>as it were:</hi> for he had after his ſtrict manner urged the Command of not Publiſhing a Faſt ſo abſolutely; that he could not, in the uſual Nicety of his Style, call even this <hi>Publick</hi> without ſome Limitation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Of other Days than thoſe in which our Saviour was <hi>taken away,</hi> there is no expreſs mention in <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:46380:43"/>But for ought appears thence, other Days there might have been obſerv'd, and ſome reaſon from him there is to think they were.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen before how very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, That the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> had a Faſt before <hi>Easter</hi> of Two Weeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their other two Faſts at other times of the Year: and had not the Catholicks of that Age obſerv'd ſome ſuch <hi>Lent</hi> too, additionally to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preſcribed Days; <hi>Tertullian</hi> muſt have been obliged to have accounted for this Innovation alſo, as well as for the other. Whereas in the 15th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he thinks himſelf bound to defend the other two Weeks only, as the Faſts peculiar to thoſe of his own Sect: and leaves us therefore to infer, That there was little difference between them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Ante-Paſchal</hi> Faſt: the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> it ſeems, having nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> about the Length of it, but only about the Neceſſity as by Divine Command; and the <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> on the other ſide, not being able to defend their certain fix'd Fortnight, by producing any number of Days tho' more, which the <hi>Catholicks</hi> kept,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46380:43"/>becauſe they were kept by them uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and under no Divine Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Management of this Diſpute, ſuch reaſon there is to think that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of his time had a longer <hi>Lent</hi> than of <hi>thoſe days</hi> only. And upon the ſame Conſiderations, the violent Preſumptions of Mr. <hi>Daillè</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, will be found of no force; neither is he to be ſuffered to conclude, That the <hi>Catholicks</hi> then kept no ſuch <hi>Lent,</hi> becauſe he did not find it formally mentioned amongſt <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the 13th and 14th Chapters. Had indeed their <hi>Lent</hi> been then as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> and <hi>Formal,</hi> as that of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church is now; the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days before <hi>Eaſter</hi> might probably have been mentioned, as well as the Fifty after: but in that Age there was a great difference between them. For the Feaſt of the Fifty days was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally kept by all, and very ſolemnly: conſpicuous if only by the Poſture they uſed, their not kneeling at their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But neither was Forty, nor any other number of Days fix'd then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for a Faſt: and beſides, as the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46380:44"/>Days were at Diſcretion, and rarely, I ſuppoſe, Forty; ſo the Faſt was for the moſt part Private, and not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Publick Action. For the ſame Reaſon of Uncertainty, the ſame Additional Days ought not to have been ſpecified in the 13th Chapter, nor mentioned in any other manner than they there are, under the general Title of <hi>other days beſides thoſe in which the Bridegroom was taken away.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſuppoſe, did he in that place think ſo much of juſtifying his <hi>Ante-Paſchal Lent,</hi> (a thing the <hi>Catholicks</hi> would eaſily allow in Subſtance, though not in Form;) as of his other two <hi>Lents,</hi> which were abſolute Novelties in the Church of Chriſt: and upon that account he might retort ſo upon the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in general, concerning the Abſtinence they thought fit to uſe through the Courſe of the reſt of the Year. But if any Adverſary will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon <hi>Tertullian</hi> the neceſſity of pleading there only for his <hi>Ante-Paſchal Lent;</hi> I may then, I think, with as much reaſon deſire him to underſtand the Author there (as the word will ſignifie, we know (<hi>n</hi> 2)) not ſpeaking
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46380:44"/>of <hi>other days Beſides,</hi> but of <hi>other days Before thoſe in which the Bridegroom,</hi> &amp;c. And then this Paſſage, inſtead of being an Objection againſt ſuch a <hi>Lent</hi> at that time, will become an expreſs Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it.</p>

                     <p>All this is ſaid upon this Paſſage as it is now read. But if there were any Manuſcripts to be conſulted, I ſhould look after the Words <hi>Quartam &amp; Sextam Sabbati,</hi> to ſee whether <hi>&amp; Sextam</hi> were not an Interpolation of ſome <hi>Copyist,</hi> who had obſerved them above, and thought they were wanting here.</p>

                        <hi>(q)</hi> Mr. <hi>Daillé,</hi> willing to have <hi>Montanus</hi> the Enlarger of the <hi>Ante-Paſchal Fast,</hi> would fain ſuppoſe the <hi>Two New Weeks</hi> of Faſting, which he inſtituted, to have been placed by him before <hi>Eaſter:</hi> and for that purpoſe cannot allow, That the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> faſted the <hi>Saturday</hi> before <hi>Eaſter;</hi> becauſe, as we ſee out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the next Paragraph, in thoſe Two Weeks they faſted not the <hi>Saturdays.</hi> But, on the contrary, we have learn'd from St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> That thoſe Two Weeks were <hi>Two New Lents</hi> (note <hi>g</hi>): and we have found too (<hi>f</hi> 2) ſome Reaſon to think, That their <hi>Lent</hi> before <hi>Eaſter</hi> was of Two other Weeks, differing, we ſuppoſe, from ſuch a <hi>Lent</hi> of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> only in this, That it was injoin'd as by Divine Precept. And beſides, this very place will not endure ſuch an Interpretation eaſily. For the <hi>Montanists</hi> are known to have declined Faſting on <hi>Saturdays,</hi> as much as the <hi>Catholicks:</hi> and upon that Account only, the <hi>Sabbatum nunquam jejunandum niſt in Paſchate,</hi> may be ſaid by them as of their own Judgment, and their own Practice. It is too moſt reaſonable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it in ſuch a manner. For here <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, and not the <hi>Catholicks;</hi> and muſt be therefore rather preſumed to have given his Own, than Their Opinion: which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſides, he ſays, was founded upon a Reaſon elſewhere given; and to ſay elſewhere, might be proper enough, if the Reaſon was any where given by himſelf in ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of his, but it was too looſe and uncertain, if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was given by ſome <hi>Catholick</hi> in general; for where ſhould one look for it? And who was he that gave it? To all this we may add, That if a <hi>Catholick</hi>'s Opinion were here expreſs'd, and his Reaſons meant, it would have been rather
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46380:46"/>thus, <hi>Quanquam vos etiam Sabbatum ſiquando continuatis, in Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Jejunandum ſecundum rationem alibi redditam:</hi> for the Faſting on the <hi>Saturday</hi> of them who did it but ſometimes, was to be the Doubt, and to require a Reaſon: though for <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> to give a <hi>Catholick</hi>'s Reaſon, and not to cenſure it, would have been very unneceſſary and very flat; Faults not uſual in his Style. And on the other ſide, if the <hi>Montanists</hi> Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there ſpoke, and they faſted not that <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> but the <hi>Catholicks</hi> did; it ſhould then inſtead of <hi>niſi</hi> have been <hi>nec,</hi> and conceived in this manner, to the Reproach of the <hi>Catholicks, Quanquam vos etiam Sabbatum ſiquando continuatis nunquam nec in Paſcha jejunandum,</hi> &amp;c. Such a Reproof of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> was likely from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and ſuch a Reflexion is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely made in the Tranſlation above; which tells of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> That they too continue the <hi>Saturday,</hi> but that they ſhould only faſt that <hi>Saturday</hi> and no other, which yet ſome of them were uſed to do.</p>
                     <p>This is all true upon the common Suppoſition, That <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſceve</hi> ſignifies <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in this place. But if it be to be taken for any <hi>Friday,</hi> the Sence of the place is plain, and Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> hath nothing to ſay.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. I. THE Age in which we now are from the 200th to the 300th Year from our Saviour's Birth, afforded not many Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and of their Writings moſt is loſt: Neither was there any Diſpute then in the Church about any thing relating to our Subject; ſo that we are not to expect very much Light thence. <hi>Hippolytus</hi> indeed, as we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned above, wrote a large Treatiſe, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46380:47"/>it ſhould ſeem, concerning the <hi>Paſchal Seaſon,</hi> Entituled, <hi>A Declaration of the Times of Eaſter:</hi> but of that, as we have ſeen, a very ſmall Fragment is preſerved. Neither, may be, would it have conduc'd much more to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe, than that Ancient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe which we have aſcrib'd to St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> or that other of <hi>Anatolius</hi> which <hi>Bucherius</hi> has given us: which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calculations of the Time in which <hi>Eaſter</hi> ſhould be kept, and not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Duty and Seaſon that was ſuppoſed to go before it. The little help therefore we ſhall find will be from <hi>Origen,</hi> and his Scholar <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from <hi>Origen</hi> we have but a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient mention of the Devotion of <hi>Fridays,</hi> and of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and a doubtful one of the Seaſon before it. The firſt is in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus:</hi> and there in Anſwer to an Accuſation of our Religion, as if it were ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, becauſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did not join in the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of thoſe Times; he replies, that, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Saying of one of the Heathen, <hi>To do ones Duty, was to keep a Holy-day;</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:46380:48"/>and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had truly ſaid, <hi>ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve days and months,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am afraid of you.</hi> But, continues he, <hi>(a) if any one ſhall object to us our</hi> Lord's-Days, <hi>and</hi> Fridays, <hi>and the</hi> Paſſover, <hi>and</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt: we reply, That a Perfect Man being always converſant in the Words and Works and Thoughts of the True Lord, makes every Day His, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keeps the <hi>Lord's-day.</hi> And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always in a Preparation of the True Life, and always abſtaining from Pleaſure, and keeping under the Body, he always keeps the Preparation-Day, <hi>[Friday].</hi> In ſuch a manner he keeps the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> paſſing from this Life to God, and haſtening to his City. And thus he who can ſay with Truth, <hi>We are Riſen with Christ,</hi> keeps the <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost.</hi> But one of the Common Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and not of the better kind, who cannot, or who will not keep every day a Holy-Day, wants ſuch ſenſible Images for his Remembrancers, that he be not wholly deficient. This Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is Allegorical, and like that of <hi>Clemens,</hi> our Author's Maſter, which we have cited above (in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. §. I.): and it is here given, not only for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46380:48"/>Confirmation of the Practice of obſerving <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Eaſter, &amp;c.</hi> but that the Reader may the better judge of a Reflection he may find made by <hi>Socrates,</hi> as if <hi>Origen</hi> had done wiſely to turn the <hi>Paſſover</hi> into <hi>Allegory,</hi> as he has done here, but more largely in that his <hi>Homily</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus</hi> which we ſhall next mention. For ſuch Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Speculations, to which the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> were much inclin'd, may be admitted to refine and ſpiritualize, but not to evacuate the Letter. This we find here, where the Obſervation of the <hi>Lord's-days</hi> is allegoriz'd, as well as of <hi>Fridays,</hi> and of the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> And we might give another Inſtance from the ſame <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who refines in the like manner upon the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Strom. <hi>6.</hi> verſus Finem.</note>; but when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns his Spiritual Meaning, of <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Kill,</hi> or <hi>Steal,</hi> muſt not be therefore ſuppoſed to have ſet aſide the Plain and Literal Sence.</p>
                     <p>Much more to our Deſign would that other Paſſage of <hi>Origen</hi> be, which we find in his <hi>Tenth Homily</hi> on <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> where, after he has enlarged in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46380:49"/>an Allegory, againſt thoſe who thought the <hi>Propitiation-day</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> was to be kept by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he ſubjoins; <hi>(c) But this we do not ſay, to let looſe the Reſtraints of Chriſtian Abſtinence; For we have the Days of the Forty Seaſon conſecrated to Fasting, and we have</hi> Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſdays <hi>and</hi> Fridays <hi>in which we ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſt.</hi> And here, under that name of the <hi>Forty Seaſon,</hi> now firſt met with, we ſhould either underſtand a <hi>Lent</hi> of <hi>Forty Days,</hi> or ſome number of Days denominated at leaſt from Forty; were we aſſured of our Authority, and had we the <hi>Text</hi> of the Author, and not the Tranſlation of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> for it. <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,</hi> I know, lies under an ill Name for Tranſlating; and has not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of any great Exactneſs: but we have found reaſon to think, that he did not do <hi>Irenaeus</hi> wrong; and it may be he has been ſuſpected here much more upon Deſign, by thoſe that are againſt <hi>Lent,</hi> than he has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by thoſe that are for it. However I ſhall be content at preſent, that this Teſtimony at the ſecond hand, may paſs for a Half-Proof; both out of the juſt Confidence I have, That within a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46380:49"/>little time it will appear, we wanted not this ſingle Evidence; as alſo with a certain foreſight, that it will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come highly Credible, and be ſeconded and ſupported by the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, from a Letter of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> a Scholar of <hi>Origen</hi>'s, and Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which chanc'd to eſcape the Fate all his other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have ſuffered, and which was writ about the middle of this Age; we may learn ſomething more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, concerning the <hi>Fast</hi> of the <hi>Paſſion-Week.</hi> We have ſeen above, what a great Controverſie had riſen about the Day, in which the <hi>Ante-Paſchal Fast</hi> ſhould end: and ſome, it ſeems, in thoſe Parts were now grown ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to deſire to have the Hour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, if not the Minute; proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that general Suppoſition, That the Faſt was to end at the Time of our Saviour's Reſurrection. A Biſhop of the Neighbourhood having been troubled about this Nicety, ſends to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the Famous Biſhop of that Capital City, for a Reſolution; and his Anſwer here follows. <hi>(d) You wrote to me, right Truſty and moſt excellent
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46380:50"/>Son, inquiring what Hour of</hi> Eaſter-Day <hi>the Faſt ſhould end. For ſome Brethren, you ſay, think it ought to end at Cock-Crow, and ſome the Evening before. For the Brethren of</hi> Rome, <hi>as they ſay, wait for the Crowing of the Cock: and thoſe here, you tell me, are ſomething ſooner. But you deſire me to give you the exact Hour, and that very preciſely and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly determin'd; a thing troubleſomely nice, and in which it is eaſie to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. This indeed will be agreed by all, That we ought to begin our Feſtival Joy after our Saviour's Reſurrection; Humbling our Souls with Fasting till that time comes. But you have proved in your Letter very well from the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, That it is not very exactly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined there, at what Hour it was that he aroſe.</hi> Thoſe places of the Goſpels he then conſiders, and infers thus: That <hi>the Setting out,</hi> and <hi>the Going of the Diſciples, to the Sepulchre, was in the deep of the Morning, and very early; but that they ſpent in their Going, and about the Sepulchre, to Sun-Riſing. This</hi> (ſays he) <hi>being the State of that Caſe. To thoſe who are ſo ſcrupulous as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the very Hour, or Half, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46380:50"/>Quarter of an Hour, when to begin the Festival, we Anſwer thus. We blame thoſe who make too much haſte, and give over before Midnight— And thoſe who hold out longer, and continue till the Fourth Watch, we commend— But to thoſe who leave off in the mean time, as their Inclination or Ability has ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, we are not ſevere. For, (not to be nice about Hours) the Six Days of Faſting themſelves are not kept equally, and alike by All. Some continuing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Food</hi> paſs over <hi>(e) the whole Six Days; ſome Two; ſome Three; ſome Four; and ſome not One. Now to thoſe who have endured ſuch Paſſings over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Suſtenance, and grow unable to hold out, and are ready to faint, to them leave is to be given for an earlier Refreſhment. But if there be any, who have been ſo far from thus paſſing over the preceding [Four] Days, that they have not ſo much as faſted (f), nay, it may be, have feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then coming to the Two laſt and onely Days, and paſſing over the</hi> Friday <hi>and</hi> Saturday, <hi>think they do a great thing if they hold on to Day-Break: As to theſe, I cannot think that they have ſtrove alike</hi> [for the Maſtery], <hi>with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46380:51"/>thoſe who had been engaged in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe more Days before.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is, from great and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authority, a very accurate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Manner in which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that Country, paſſed the Week before <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> Nor is it to be doubted, but that thoſe generally of other Places obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it with more than ordinary Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence; though they might not come up to all this Auſterity; and though the <hi>Aegyptian Chriſtians,</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> (for ſo I take <hi>Philo</hi>'s <hi>Eſſenes</hi> to have been) may have been the greateſt Faſters each of their own Religion. Some, we are told, wholly abſtain'd from Food, or paſs'd over all the Six Days; ſome Four, beginning with <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> ſome Three, and ſome Two. And theſe laſt did the leaſt of thoſe who pretended to <hi>Paſs Over:</hi> for he mentions none who thought fit to begin on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> and ſo to paſs over but One whole Day. He mentions indeed ſome who paſs'd over not ſo much as One: but it is plain, that theſe were very few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Reſt; and it is beſides ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46380:51"/>that thoſe who did not Paſs over a day altogether, might however in the Language of this Author have Faſted a day till the Evening: and in this manner it is probable they that Paſs'd not over one day, did however Faſt more than one, and poſſibly all the Six, in the ſelf-ſame Manner in which we now keep the moſt ſolemn of our Faſts.</p>
                     <p>Such Abſtinence was us'd in the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-Week</hi> at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and, in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in moſt other Churches: for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> begins with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Other places; and does not at all ſeem to appropriate the Practice to that ſingle City. When therefore St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Cotemporary and Correſpondent of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> ſpeaks occaſionally of the firſt Solemnities of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> which detained his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Biſhops, at their own Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>(g);</hi> we may very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them to be the <hi>Devotions</hi> of the <hi>Holy Week:</hi> and ſuppoſe, that the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Seven Days before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and Seven after, which by the Law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great was made a Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Courts of Juſtice <hi>(h);</hi> had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46380:52"/>been before kept holy by the pious Uſage of the elder <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this will ſeem the leſs ſtrange, if we reflect upon the Practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> about the ſame Seaſon. We ſhall hereafter endeavour to ſhew, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Uſages were derived from them: and it will not be deny'd by any, That our <hi>Eaſter</hi> anſwers in ſome ſort to their <hi>Paſſover-Day,</hi> and the Seven Holy-days after the one, to the Seven after the other. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd: but it is not improbable, that the Days before <hi>Eaſter</hi> had ſome ſuch regard too. The <hi>Monday</hi> of that Week, we have ſeen in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was ſuppoſed to be the Day, in which the <hi>High-Prieſts</hi> reſolved on our Saviour's Death; as it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in their Law for the Day, in which they were to ſingle out their Paſchal Lamb: and this, as we there obſerved, may have ſeemed ſufficient Reaſon to the Ancient <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to begin their ſtricter Devotion then. But it is beſides obſervable, and remarked by <hi>Theophylact (i),</hi> That the <hi>Jews</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly began to make Entertainments, and commenced their Feſtivity the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46380:52"/>Day before, that on which he ſuppoſes our Saviour was entertained at <hi>Bethany,</hi> the ſixth day before the <hi>Paſſover:</hi> (if they did not earlyer). And this, in the general, is the more probable, from the Appellation the <hi>Jews</hi> now give the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> before the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> calling it the <hi>Great Sabbath:</hi> a Greatneſs, I ſuppoſe, in which the reſt of the days of that Week had their ſhare. For as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us<note n="(k)" place="margin">John 11.55.</note>, That <hi>many came up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſover to purifie themſelves,</hi> and to offer Sacrifices for their Sins: ſo too we may preſume, many came to pay the Peace-Offerings they had vow'd; and of them, the moſt ſolemn, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical, were not capable, by reaſon of their Leavened Bread which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them<note n="(l)" place="margin">Levit. 7.13.</note>, to be offered on any of the latter ſeven days, and made up therefore, as we have reaſon to think, the Solemnity of the Seaſon before. Now if thoſe days before the <hi>Paſſover</hi> were thus diſtinguiſhed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their <hi>Feſtivity;</hi> they might be among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as much diſtinguiſhed by their <hi>Abſtinence:</hi> according to the Rule of that <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitution,</hi> (produc'd by the <hi>Audaeans,</hi> for their keeping the 14th Day, after the manner<note n="(l 2)" place="margin">See Ch. 1. §. 3.</note>, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46380:53"/>of the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi>); which <hi>Epiphanius thus</hi> gives us <hi>(m). When They</hi> [the Jews] <hi>Feaſt, do you Faſt, and Mourn for them; for in the day of their Feaſt, they Crucified Chriſt: and when they Mourn, eating their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened Bread, with Bitter Herbs; do you Feaſt.</hi> For here the time of <hi>Feaſting,</hi> firſt mention'd, might be extended alſo to thoſe Days <hi>Before</hi>

                        </note> as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to the Erection of the Tabernacle. And though we are told, that the Jews do no Penitential Office this whole Month; yet its Feſtivalneſs muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of its firſt half. For from, the Morrow of the Paſſover, the 16th day, they are like Mourners; and continue under that ſadneſs; ſome, above Thirty Days; and ſome, all ſave one, to Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 19.</note>. And ſo, tho' that Conſtitution ſpecifies the 14th day only, for the time of Jewiſh <hi>Mourning;</hi> becauſe on that only they were bound to eat the bitter Herbs, and that <hi>(p)</hi> Unſavoury Bread; yet the reaſon of the Ordinance might reach to the 7 Weeks from the 16th, in which the Jews forbid themſelves all chearfulneſs; and which, as we have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46380:53"/>ſeen, were ſtill paſs'd by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> on the other hand, with all demonſtrations of Joy.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Inſtances of this Age, of which we were now ſpeaking. It is plain, from what we chance to know of this Matter, That the <hi>Paſſion-Week</hi> was ſtrictly obſerved: And it will be unreaſonable to think, as ſome would perſwade us to do, That there was then no time faſted before that Week, becauſe here is no mention made by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of ſuch a Time. For the Holy Man deſcribes the Faſting of this Week but caſually, and upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion only; being led from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ending of the <hi>Fast,</hi> to conſider its different Beginning. The Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therefore of ſuch a Faſt only was to be conſidered by him, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without Interpoſition of Food till <hi>Eaſter-Day:</hi> and for that Reaſon the Faſts of the preceding Weeks, which were diſcontinued, and ſeparated from the laſt Week, by the intervening <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays,</hi> had no place here, and could not properly be mentioned by him on this Argument.</p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:46380:54"/>
                     <p>On the contrary, we cannot but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, That thoſe who kept this Week ſo ſtrictly, did not fail to uſe ſome ſort of Abſtinence more than ordinary in the time before; if any ſuch Seaſon was then any where in uſe with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> ſuch a Seaſon as we had ſome Reaſon to infer from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian;</hi> and ſhall find in the beginning of the next Age much celebrated, and obſerved well nigh univerſally. To which I may add, That if the Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture I offer at on <hi>Socrates</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Ch. 10. §. III.</note> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; it will then be probable, That full Three Weeks were formally kept at this time in <hi>Rome.</hi> For if in the Days of <hi>Socrates,</hi> when the <hi>Catholicks</hi> generally obſerved ſo large a <hi>Lent,</hi> the <hi>Roman Novatians</hi> obſerved but Three Weeks; it was, in all likelihood, for this Reaſon; Becauſe the <hi>Novatians</hi> of that Place, where the Schiſm was firſt founded, adhered more ſtifly to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of their firſt Separation, and would not comply with the Enlargements the <hi>Catholicks</hi> made, as thoſe of the ſame Sect, in other Cities might have been induc'd to do.</p>

Before the Perſecution began, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Century, the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Chair of that great Chriſtian City, <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in which the above-nam'd <hi>Dionyſius</hi> had ſate, was now fill'd by one <hi>Peter,</hi> a very venerable Perſon, Eminent for his Knowledge and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and who at laſt ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Year 311. And upon the riſing of this ſharp Perſecution, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had behaved themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differently; ſome had endured to the laſt with admirable Conſtancy; ſome yielded and deni'd their Religion, after the ſuffering of grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſome upon the offer of Torture, after they had undergone the Pains of Impriſonment; and ſome at the firſt Accuſation. Of thoſe too, who had not renounc'd, ſome had eſcaped by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46380:57"/>Flight; ſome by buying off the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; and ſome by hiring Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to atteſt to ſome Idolatrous Act of theirs, which had been never done. Of all theſe ſorts, there were many who deſired to be re-admitted to the Communion of the Church, and ſome had now long ſought it with much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: to whoſe various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances different Rules were therefore to be ſuited, ſuch as this <hi>Peter,</hi> after deliberation had with his Brethren, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in a Diſcourſe now loſt; but from which ſome Excerpts had been made in form of Canons, and by that means preſerved to us. The <hi>firſt</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, as <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Balſamon</hi> give it, is thus <hi>(a);</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereas now the fourth</hi> Eaſter <hi>is come upon this Perſecution; it may ſuffice for thoſe, who were accuſed, and impriſoned, and indured inſufferable Tortures, and intolerable ſcourgings, and many other grievous Cruelties, but after all were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by the Weakneſs of the Fleſh; [for thoſe, I ſay,] though they were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Communion at firſt, by reaſon of that their great Apoſtaſie; yet becauſe they ſtrove much, and reſiſted a long while,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46380:57"/>(for they fell not upon Choice, but were betrayed by the Weakneſs of the Fleſh,) and becauſe they bear ſtill in their Bodies the Marks of their Lord, and ſome of them have been mourning theſe three Years; [for theſe, I ſay, it may ſuffice,] That a Penance of Other Forty Days, to be reckon'd from after their Admiſſion, ſhould be additionally inflicted on them, for their Admonition: which Forty days, tho' our Saviour had faſted after Baptiſm, yet He was tempted of the Devil; in which they too being exerciſed ſuper abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and more earneſtly ſober, may watch unto Prayer, continually medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on that Anſwer, given by our Lord, when he was urged by the Tempter to fall down and worſhip him;</hi> Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>firſt</hi> Canon: and for the better underſtanding of it we only add, That the <hi>ſecond</hi> impoſes another Year's Penance, upon thoſe who had ſuffered the Pain and Miſery of Impriſonment, but did not reſiſt Torture; and that the <hi>third</hi> puts thoſe off to the End of another Year for Trial, and not till
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46380:58"/>then to receive their Sentence, who out of Fear and Cowardlineſs had yielded preſently.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. II. Forty Days of Faſting, and ſtrict Devotion are here ſingularly and eminently mentioned: but in what part of the Year they were plac'd, it is not here certainly determined. If by <hi>the fourth</hi> Eaſter <hi>is come,</hi> as I have render'd it, may be underſtood <hi>is now coming;</hi> and the Biſhop's Diſcourſe may be dated before <hi>Eaſter:</hi> thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days would then be in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity before <hi>Eaſter</hi> too, and the very <hi>Lent</hi> which we are now looking after. They muſt undoubtedly have ſome near A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect upon <hi>Eaſter:</hi> For why elſe is it mentioned, and the Years of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reckoned by it? And no time was ſo proper to re-admit Penitents ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſtian Communion, as this of the <hi>Paſſover;</hi> when the Pardon of our Sins was recogniz'd, by the ſolemn Memory of our Saviour's Death on the <hi>Friday;</hi> and the Holy Communion, the Sacrament of his Death, was ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly frequented on the <hi>Sunday:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any Seaſon of the Year more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46380:58"/>fit for the ſtricter Humiliation of the Penitent, than that on which all good Chriſtians were ready to join in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the like Devotion. For this Reaſon, we may juſtly ſuppoſe, St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ep. 56.</hi> Edit. Oxon.</note> was conſulted before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> about the ſame Caſe, the Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who had been Penitents three Years; that if he had anſwered favourably, they might have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at the approaching Feſtival. So have we, under this Suppoſition, a <hi>Lent</hi> of <hi>Forty Days</hi> for Penitents at leaſt, to be kept throughout by them, and with great Severity: while the reſt, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as early, and uſing ſuch Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence as their Diſcretion directed, and the Neceſſities of their Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; equalled generally the Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities even of thoſe, at the latter End. And this way if we are allowed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Canon, the <hi>Other Forty Days</hi> there mentioned, may then reſpect the former <hi>Three Lents</hi> that had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: except any one would rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that one <hi>particular Lent</hi> to be intimated, which had been kept by theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> juſt before they were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, (which too was done generally
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46380:59"/>at <hi>Eaſter,</hi>) and which they were now ordered to keep in the ſame manner again, before they ſhould be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church.</p>
                     <p>And thus the <hi>Forty Penitential. Days</hi> will be the very <hi>Forty Days</hi> of <hi>Lent,</hi> if we ſuppoſe the Synod to be held before <hi>Eaſter:</hi> as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afterwards. But if it was not, and they did not concur with ſuch a <hi>Lent,</hi> they will however infer It. Let us then ſuppoſe the <hi>Synod</hi> to have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it was; for it is not unlikely that the Order of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in this Particular, was a Change of the old Practice; which Order was rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a little time, by the Council of <hi>Antioch:</hi> and beſides we ſee that the Synod of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> a Synod held on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the ſame Perſecution, and much about the ſame time, did meet after <hi>Eaſter;</hi> for they ſpeak of the <hi>Great Day,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and ſeem to reckon it to be about a Year, before it would come again.</p>
                     <p>Under this Suppoſition, that Synod of <hi>Ancyra</hi> will help us to underſtand the other of <hi>Alexandria</hi> more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46380:59"/>In its <hi>6th Canon,</hi> it decrees, <hi>(c) That thoſe who had yielded coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bare Threats, and had not profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Repentance till the time of the Synod, ſhould be only admitted to Hear</hi> the Scripture and the Sermons, (as hopeful <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> were permitted to do) <hi>untill the Great Day: and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Great Day they ſhould be of the Claſs of thoſe who Kneel'd,</hi> and Pray'd, and Supplicated for Pardon, (as the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> did for Baptiſm) <hi>and ſo continue three Years: And then for two Years more, they ſhould Communicate with the Brethren in Prayer, but not in the Euchariſt: And finally, after ſix Years thus ſpent, they ſhould be received into full and free Communion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find by this <hi>Canon,</hi> that the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Space</hi> of time, were it longer or ſhorter, was generally determined by <hi>Eaſters:</hi> and ſee that <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> therefore reckoned by them. And further, when he does thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Penitents the Favour, after ſome Years Mourning, to enjoin them only the <hi>Penance</hi> of <hi>Forty Days:</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Indulgence to have been ſo much, as to have remitted that <hi>Yearly</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:46380:60"/>time, they ſhould otherwiſe have been kept, at leaſt, from the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> and to have given them their <hi>Lent</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. For laſtly, when he ſays they ſhould <hi>fast other forty days,</hi> and ſays this after <hi>Eaſter;</hi> we cannot doubt but that he refers to the <hi>Forty days</hi> lately paſs'd in <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> and which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the preceding Year; which too, as it ſeems, were paſs'd in ordinary courſe, and not by any particular Injunction of his, for he appears not to have given any Orders in this Matter before. So very probable it is, even from this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Teſtimony, That a <hi>Lent</hi> of <hi>Forty Days</hi> was kept at <hi>Alexandria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council of <hi>Nice:</hi> and that we ſhould ſo think, we are now going to ſee what great Reaſon there is from that Council it ſelf.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. I. WE come now to the firſt General Council, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Nice,</hi> under the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperour, in the Year 325: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things taken into their Conſideration, another <hi>Paſchal Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> was then adjuſted.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46380:61"/>a more Reformed Account of their own, agreeable to the Directions of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It was therefore thought fit by the Council, That ſuch a notable Difformity among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſuch an Agreement with the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the <hi>Principal Chriſtian Solemnity,</hi> things in that time, as it appears, very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſhould no longer continue: which Regulation the Emperour himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſo much, as to notifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the Churches in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Letter, tranſmitted to after Ages by <hi>Euſebius.</hi> There <hi>(c)</hi> he tells them, That <hi>a Queſtion having been raiſed about the moſt Holy Day of the Paſſover, it was thought fit, by unanimous Conſent, to keep it every where on the ſame Day.— That it was extreamly improper to keep that moſt Holy Feaſt, from which we have received the Hopes of Immortality, after the Cuſtom of the Jews, who embrued their hands in that wicked Action.</hi> That <hi>ſetting aſide the Jewiſh Manner, there was a truer Courſe and Calculation, by which the Solemnity of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which had been kept from the firſt Paſſion-Day, might be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after perpetuated to all Ages</hi>—.

                     <p n="2">§. II. THE 5th. Canon <hi>(f)</hi> after it has decreed, (upon the Occaſion, it is ſuppos'd, of <hi>Arius,</hi> having been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Communion by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Excommunication;) <hi>That thoſe who have been Ejected by one Biſhop, ſhould not be Admitted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> to provide againſt unjuſt Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46380:63"/>upon Quarrel and Paſſion, does order, <hi>That for the Examination of ſuch Cauſes, Two Synods a Year ſhould be held in every Province.

                     <p>Here now is a certain undiſputed Mention of the <hi>Forty Seaſon,</hi> made by this Great Aſſembly of Confeſſours: but Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> is very unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them of <hi>Forty Days.</hi> He rather would think, becauſe the word <hi>Forty Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> will be found hereafter ſome times to ſignifie a <hi>Lent</hi> in general, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Space; that therefore it aroſe firſt from the <hi>Forty Hours</hi> he fanſied in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and afterwards gave its name to that <hi>Fast</hi> as it increas'd in Space; and was now at length come to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Paſſion-Week;</hi> as it will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſome time have ſo many <hi>Days</hi> added to it as ſhall make up the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Forty.</hi> And, he ſays, <hi>Forty Days</hi> muſt not be underſtood here: for in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46380:64"/>ſo large a time, new Quarrels might be rais'd; and the Synods too muſt be held in <hi>February,</hi> an inconvenient Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the Biſhops to travel.</p>
                     <p>But this Original of the <hi>Forty Seaſon</hi> from ſo many <hi>Hours,</hi> is a meer Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and grounded upon a very doubtful Conſtruction of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Phraſe, which rather requires to be underſtood of <hi>Forty Days,</hi> as has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appeared. Neither is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to imagine, That a Word which ſignifies <hi>Forty,</hi> ſhould be put to ſignifie <hi>Six Days of Faſting;</hi> now when we know from the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that <hi>Forty Days</hi> have been before obſerv'd for a Solemn Space of Penitential Devotion: and much leſs reaſonable when we ſhall know, that ſo many Days in this ſelf ſame Age hereafter will always be aim'd at, and as near as may be approached to, in the Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lent,</hi> as we ſhall preſently ſee.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. THERE is therefore lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need that I ſhould go further for the fixing the Signification of that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46380:64"/>Word in this Canon: but it may be further cleared from St. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> He was in <hi>Antioch,</hi> the chief place of the <hi>East,</hi> where that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was kept, which the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had ordered to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: and the People were ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to it, (as they were too to other Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews</hi>); that though the Obſervation of it was again forbid by a Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> in the Year 341; yet ſome of them continued ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly to adhere to it, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this Eloquent Prieſt, to interrupt the Order of his Diſcourſes, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow one whole Sermon upon the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their Schiſmatical Diſſent.

St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> therefore acquaints them, That <hi>the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration was made by the Wiſdom and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Great Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>thoſe illuſtrious Confeſſours of the Chriſtian Faith: that they thought it unfit for them any longer to follow the Jews in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Calculation, and that the whole World agreed to the Ordinance.</hi> He tells
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46380:65"/>them, <hi>That the Jewiſh Paſſover is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd; That Chriſt is the Paſſover of the Chriſtians; and That it is celebrated by them every Communion.</hi> To which he adds, <hi>(g) Why then, ſay you, do we faſt theſe Forty Days? Becauſe anciently many were uſed to come to theſe Myſteries without due Preparation, and particularly at this time in which our Saviour inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sacrament; the Fathers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well the Miſchief of ſuch a Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, being come together, appointed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days of Faſting, Praying, Hearing, and Aſſembling; that we being all care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully purified in theſe Days both by Prayer, and by Alms, and by Faſting, and by Watching, and by Tears, and by Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by all other Duties; may ſo draw near, as far as is poſſible for us, with a pure Conſcience. And how great the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Ordinance was, in bringing us to a Cuſtom of Faſting, is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hence. For if we all the Year long Cry up and Preach the Duty of Faſting never ſo much, there is no body that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to what is ſaid: but when the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Forty Days is once come, tho' none exhort or adviſe them; yet every one, even the moſt negligent, ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46380:65"/>to it, by the Advice and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Seaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I take it to be very plain, That the Fathers here ſpoke of for <hi>Lent,</hi> are the ſame with thoſe mentioned but juſt before for <hi>Eaſter.</hi> For had they been of any other Council, or Synod; they would have been nam'd with ſome diſtinction. And if any one would be ſo unreaſonable, as to ſuppoſe ſome other Council meant, yet he muſt remember, that it muſt be ſuch a one as might be ſtil'd <hi>Ancient</hi> about the Year 390; and therefore rather before that of 325, than after: and then he muſt withal reflect, that he gives me an Earlier Authority, than that for which I now contend. But unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably, as I think, St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers: and if we take his Judgment, we ſee evidently that they, by their <hi>Forty Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> could intend nothing elſe but their <hi>Forty Days.</hi> It is true indeed, that there is no particular <hi>Canon</hi> to be found, that injoins this <hi>Lent</hi> of <hi>Forty Days:</hi> but neither is the Ordinance about <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> found in the <hi>Canons,</hi> though it was ſuch a diſputed Point.

                        </gap> it may
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46380:66"/>too very well be, that the Obſervation of <hi>Forty Days</hi> was rather interlocuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily agreed upon, than formally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd; and not therefore injoin'd in any other <hi>Canon,</hi> but imply'd in this of which we now ſpeak; and that the Churches of differing Cuſtoms, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily came in to this Uniformity of <hi>Lent,</hi> upon the general Direction they received to Conform in the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So has it appear'd, That Mr. <hi>Dail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lé</hi>'s Refuſal, to underſtand <hi>Forty Days</hi> by the <hi>Forty Seaſon,</hi> was not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded and arbitrary, neither deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Practice juſt before the time of the <hi>Canon,</hi> nor agreeable to that after; but withal directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the expreſs Affirmation of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> For as to the Objections he has brought, if they are worth mentioning: the Inconvenience he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that in ſo long a time as <hi>Forty Days</hi> they might quarrel again, after their Synodical Reconciliation; ſeems to be ſaid with more Favour to his own <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> than Reſpect to thoſe Venerable Perſons: and the other of a <hi>February</hi> Journey, though of Elder
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46380:66"/>Men, to the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a Province, where other Buſineſs too might call them, is not very great; it was not at leaſt ſo conſiderable to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, as that of their continuing at Difference one with another in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seaſon.</hi> But not to be difficult in ſmall things; we will grant that this Inconvenience might be one of the Reaſons, why the above-named Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the 24th <hi>Canon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd it to its former Place after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and ſettled it in the 4th Week: and it ſeems indeed by the ſpecial Aſſignation of a Reaſon, for the time of a Synod before <hi>Lent;</hi> that it was firſt fix'd there, by this Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after all, the <hi>Forty Seaſon</hi> there muſt ſtand for <hi>Forty Days:</hi> and we cannot but obſerve, That it is not ſet down as any newly rais'd word, but as one already well known, and of as common a Signification as <hi>Spring</hi> or <hi>Autumn.</hi> From whence what we have before ſuggeſted, plainly now appears, That ſuch a Number of Days had been in much Uſe before in many places, at leaſt in the laſt Age: tho' no mention of them happen'd to occur, in the few <hi>Writings</hi> that remain.</p>

                     <p>Of a <hi>Fast</hi> before <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> I gave there a very early Teſtimony from <hi>Juſtin Martyr:</hi> and what was then further intimated, might have been confirmed from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> That <hi>for Baptiſm the Paſchal Seaſon afforded a ſolemn Day.</hi> And now in this Age, we cannot but think, That the <hi>Lent</hi> of Forty Days, which is acknowledged to have been kept commonly by all the Faithful, was more particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by thoſe who were to be <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> at the concluſion of it. On this Subject therefore it will be enough, to produce the ſingle Evidence of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                     <p>He is judg'd to have been made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there in the Year 350: and was <hi>Presbyter Catechiſt</hi> before; whoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it was to inſtruct and prepare thoſe Candidates, and whoſe Catechiſtical Lectures are ſtill preſerved.

There is a large Time given you. You have the Penance before you of</hi> Forty Days: <hi>ſufficient Space and

                     <p>This was unqueſtionably the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Fourth Century: and now I ſhall leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to obſerve, how much of this <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> deſcribes as done in his time. After he had ſaid what we now cited, That <hi>there was in the Paſchal Seaſon a more ſolemn Day for Baptiſm,</hi> he adds in the next <hi>Chapter, (f) Thoſe who are going to be baptiz'd, ought to pray with frequent Prayers, with Faſtings, and Kneelings, and Watchings, and wth the Confeſſion of all their former Sins. For by this Affliction of the Fleſh and the Spirit, we at the ſame time make ſome Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for what is past, and fortifie our ſelves against Temptations for the future.</hi> Watch and pray, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that ye enter not into temptation. <hi>And I preſume they [the Diſciples] were therefore ſo far tempted, becauſe they ſlept—Our Lord himſelf was ſurrounded with Tentations, preſently after his Baptiſm, when he had performed [his] Faſts Forty Days. And therefore may ſome one ſay, We too ſhould rather faſt after Baptiſm:</hi>—Now in this place I confeſs, it is not evident, that the <hi>Paſchal Vigils,</hi> and the <hi>Forty Days Faſt</hi> before <hi>Eaſter</hi> are particularly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46380:70"/>meant; and therefore heretofore I did not bring this Paſſage for a Proof: but neither is it improbable that they are intended; for the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſleeping agrees to the time of thoſe <hi>Vigils;</hi> and the Forty Days Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence of our Saviour, being not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with any intimation of the one continued extraordinary Faſt, but as ſo many Faſtings, may alſo well refer to thoſe of the <hi>Catechumen.</hi>

                     <p n="2">§. II. IT has appeared already from the Synod of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> That Forty Days had been in Uſe for a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Faſt before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>And as for the Faſt of Penitents, how proper Forty Days are for that Office, I ſhall give the Authority of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on <hi>Jonas:</hi> excribing the whole Paſſage, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it will be of further Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hereafter. The old Tranſlation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46380:70"/>of the 3d. Chapter of <hi>Jonas</hi> at the 14th. Verſe, was thus, <hi>Yet three days and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed:</hi> upon which he ſays, <hi>(g) The Number Three, which is put by the</hi> Septuagint, <hi>is not proper for Penitents. And I can't but wonder how it came to be ſo tranſlated; ſeeing in the Hebrew there is no Agreement either in the Letters, or Syllables, or Accents, or Words. Beſides the Prophet ſent from</hi> Judaea, <hi>on ſo long a journey, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Penitence worthy of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that ſuch old and putrid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers might be cured with a Plaiſter, that ſhould lie ſome longer time upon them. Now Forty is a number that is proper for Penitents, and Faſting, and Prayer, and Sackcloth, and Tears, and Perſeverance in deprecating God's Anger. For which reaſon</hi> Moſes <hi>alſo faſted forty days in Mount</hi> Sinai: <hi>and</hi> Elias, <hi>flying from</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel, <hi>and the Wrath of God impending upon</hi> Iſrael, <hi>is deſcrib'd to have faſted forty days. Our Lord likewiſe himſelf, the true</hi> Jonas, <hi>who was ſent to preach [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance] to the World; faſted forty days: and leaving to us the Inheritance of his Faſting, ſtill prepares our Souls for the Eating of his Body by the ſame Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

                     <p>Here we have the Fitneſs of Forty Days for Penance, in the Judgment of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and we ſuppoſe of the Church of his time; the onely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark thence we make as yet.</p>

It thus begins: <hi>(h) This too is one of thoſe things which appertain to the Holy Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival, the conſideration of the Rightful and Canonical Diſpenſation which is to be exerciſed upon Offenders; that every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Malady, which has been contracted by any Sin, may have its proper Cure. For ſeeing this Catholick Feſtival, the Feſtival of the Creation, kept throughout the World every Year, in the ſtated Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the Annual Circle, is celebrated for the Reſurrection of him that fell; and Sin is a Fall, and Riſing up from the Fall of Sin is a Reſurrection: it muſt be very proper on this Day, not only to bring to God by the Grace of the Font, ſuch
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46380:71"/>as are transform'd by Regeneration; but thoſe too, who by Penitence and turning to God are come back from dead Works into the way of Life, to lead theſe as it were by the hand to that ſaving Hope, from which they have been eſtranged by Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The meaning of this Preface is plain, That a Penitential Diſcourſe was as proper a Subject before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> as a Catechiſtical. And this he might think fit to premiſe; becauſe in thoſe times there might ſeem to be more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the Catechiſtical; then when by the Grace of God the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who needed ſolemn Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was very inconſiderable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the multitude of Adult Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to Chriſtianity. And for the ſame reaſon, I preſume, Penance appears more formally in the <hi>Lents</hi> of ſome Ages hereafter, than it did before; becauſe few grown Perſons were then to be baptiz'd, to whom Catechiſtical Diſcourſes belong'd; and occaſion for the other, the Penitential Exhortations, there was then too much: not but that the ſolemn Preparation of Penitents by <hi>Lent,</hi> might have been as ancient well nigh, as that of the Candidates for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46380:72"/>Baptiſm. The Reaſon certainly for their Admiſſion at <hi>Eaſter</hi> was the ſame: as our Author has ſuggeſted, and we have before obſerv'd.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. I. THE Reader may perceive, by the liberty we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this Digreſſion, concerning <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi> that we are now at leiſure, and free of all Difficulties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Actual Obſervation of the Forty Seaſon. And indeed about the Faſt of it Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> henceforth gives us no trouble; but againſt the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Right, he is ſtill looking out for Evidence. But in that Point the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may have already underſtood, how little we are concern'd: who do not pretend to prove, That a <hi>Lent</hi> of ſo many certain Days was obſerv'd in the latter end of the Apoſtolical Age; but that ſome <hi>Lent</hi> there then was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally kept by all, and probably of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days by ſome in the ſecond Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46380:73"/>a thing that will not, I preſume, appear ſo ſtrange, when we come to the Second Part of this Diſcourſe. Though therefore I am inclinable to believe, that there was very anciently ſome regard had to the Number <hi>Forty;</hi> and that this in proceſs of time increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very much, ſo as to have been the Solemn Number of <hi>Lent</hi> in many Churches by the End of the Third Century: yet I am willing to allow, from what we have ſeen of St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> That this Obſervation grew ſo univerſal from the Recommendation of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers. Thoſe Forty Days too, though regarded and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet I do not ſay, that they were all of them faſted, and every where equally: but am ready to allow what St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> intimates<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p n="2">§. II. That alſo which <hi>Caſſian</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s ſays, and is us'd to be produc'd upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46380:74"/>as an unanſwerable Objection againſt the Antiquity of <hi>Lent,</hi> I have no need to diſſemble. <hi>It is to be known,</hi> ſays he, <hi>(b) that this Obſervation of forty days, [as it is now ſtrictly injoyn'd,] had no being as long as the Perfection of the Primitive Church continued. For thoſe who enlarged the Faſt throughout the whole Year, were not confined by the neceſſity of this Ordinance, nor within ſuch narrow bounds of Faſting, as if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Legal Restraint. But when the Multitude of Believers, daily falling off from that Apoſtolical Devotion, began to grow worldly—: then it was thought fit by the Biſhops of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, That Men, immerſed in the Cares of the World, and wholly ignorant, if I may ſo ſay, of any ſuch thing as Abſtinence and Repentance, ſhould be reduced to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty by this Canonical Injunction of Faſts; and compelled to it, as it were, by the Impoſition of a Legal Tenth (c): An Injunction advantageous to the weak, and which cannot be prejudicial to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; thoſe, who being under the Grace of the Goſpel, by their voluntary Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [already] exceed the preſcribed Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:46380:74"/>
                     <p>I ſhall not now obſerve, what ſome might venture to ſay; That <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſpeaks all this upon Miſtake, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Euſebius</hi> here, what he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently does in another place <hi>(d),</hi> That the <hi>Aegyptian Eſſenes,</hi> deſcrib'd by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> were Diſciples of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and that the Primitive Chriſtians lived all at firſt in that Auſterity. I ſhall only remark, that <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſpeaks here of the <hi>forty days,</hi> and not of a <hi>Lent</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and of their being faſted by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and not at Diſcretion. And therefore thoſe Perfect Men of his, who faſted the whole Year, might however have faſted ſome peculiar time before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> with a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Devotion; (for that they faſted all the Days cannot be meant by him, much leſs with an equal Abſtinence:) and they might too, ſome of them, have ſo particularly faſted Forty Days, though not by Legal Direction, yet by their own Choice, notwithſtanding any thing ſaid in this place. If too we underſtand the time, when theſe Forty Days were firſt impoſed by common Conſent, to have been that of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; this is no more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46380:75"/>than we before had from his Maſter St. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> But if he means ſome elder Times, and he may the very firſt Age; (For they began to be luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm very early, as we learn from ſome parts of the New Teſtament); we have then a Teſtimony from <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> of a much higher Antiquity, for this <hi>Quadrageſimal Inſtitution.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that which he adds, concerning the Impoſition of Forty Days, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it began, that it was no hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Perfect; is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be conſider'd by all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Perfection. For the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he intimates, though not made for the Perfect, would however be kept by them: and they would ſhew they were under Grace, by Exceeding, and not by Tranſgreſſing the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Law. In as much as he that faſts every day, will not fail to faſt forty: and he that is ready to offer his whole Time, will not hold back the Tenth.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. WE ſee how far <hi>Caſſian</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are from any Reflexion upon the Inſtitution of <hi>Lent:</hi> and thoſe of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46380:75"/>St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> alledg'd uſually for the ſame Purpoſe, apparently require the ſame Conſtruction; and need only to be ſeen, if the Reader will bear the length of the Paſſage. <hi>(e) Some may ſay, if it be not lawful to obſerve Days and Months,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we then are under the like Guilt, who obſerve</hi> Wedneſday, <hi>and</hi> Friday, <hi>and the</hi> Lord'<hi>s</hi> Day, <hi>and the</hi> Faſt <hi>of the</hi> Forty Seaſon, <hi>and the</hi> Holy Days <hi>of the</hi> Paſſover, <hi>and the</hi> Joy <hi>of the</hi> Pentecoſt, <hi>and the ſeveral Days that are kept in ſeveral Countries in Honour of Martyrs. To this he that will give the plain Anſwer, will reply; That the Days the</hi> Jews <hi>obſerve, are not the ſame with ours. For we do not celebrate the Paſſover of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened Bread, but of the Reſurrection, and the Croſs: neither do we in</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>reckon the Seven Weeks with the</hi> Jews, <hi>but in Veneration of the Coming of the</hi> Holy Ghoſt. <hi>And leaſt the want of orderly Aſſembling ſhould be a Cauſe of Decay of Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Days in which we ſhould come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been appointed: not that the Day in which we meet is of it ſelf more ſolemn; but that in what day ſoever it be we meet, there may ariſe a Feſtival Joy
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46380:76"/>from our mutual ſight one of another. This is the plain Anſwer. But he that would endeavour to give a more Acute and Refined one, will ſay; That all Days are equal, and that</hi> Friday <hi>is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day of the</hi> Crucifixion, <hi>nor the</hi> Lord'<hi>s</hi> Day <hi>of the</hi> Reſurrection: <hi>but that there is always a Reſurrection-Day to Him, and that he always feeds on our Lord's Body: but that ſuch Days of Faſting and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling have been preſcribed by Wiſe Men, for the ſake of thoſe who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed more about the World than God, and cannot, or rather will not, aſſemble together every day of their Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Plain Anſwer, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, is not judg'd by St. <hi>Jerome</hi> to be the worſt. And the other, the more Subtil one, reliſhes, we know, of the Refinement and Allegory of <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> from whom, I ſuppoſe, it was taken: and what we before obſerved, is now to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, That the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day</hi> it ſelf is here put in the ſame Caſe with the Days of <hi>Lent, &amp;c.</hi> and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their Inſtitution is common, and that they are ſaid alike all of them to have had Prudent Men for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46380:76"/>Now thoſe prudent Men, if they were the Authors of the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> muſt have been the Apoſtles themſelves, as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Authors of the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of a <hi>Lent</hi> were at leaſt Apoſtolical: but if they are to be underſtood the Authors of the <hi>Injunction</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> in that ſenſe poſſibly the Authors for the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> might have been Apoſtolical; and thoſe for an <hi>Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lent</hi> beyond <hi>Good-Friday</hi> or <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> yet later. He too that makes this laſt anſwer, and ſeems to ſlight the Ordinance of Times and Days; does it in Vertue of his great Perfection, ſuch of which <hi>Caſſian</hi> now ſpake: One who is above the Ordinance, becauſe he never wanted it; as a charitable Chriſtian is above the Law againſt <hi>Stealing:</hi> and does not plead for the Abridgment of the Faſt, but for the Extending it throughout the Year; therefore accounting no Single Day Holy, becauſe All are ſo to him.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ IV. THESE are the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the devout <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Lent,</hi> brought out of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46380:77"/>
                        <hi>Caſſian:</hi> others there are from St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> but of the like Nature, and not worth the anſwering. As when he ſays, in the Paſſage above produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, That <hi>every Communion is a Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;</hi> he ſpeaks it partly in the ſenſe now mentioned; and beſides in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Superſtition of thoſe <hi>Syrians,</hi> who took the <hi>Levitical</hi> Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> to be ſtill in force. And when he elſewhere prefers the <hi>Abſtinence from Vice,</hi> as from <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> before that <hi>from Meats;</hi> it is plain he ſpeaks not againſt the Obſervation of that Abſtinence, as a thing not to be practis'd; but as a thing abſurd and unprofitable, without a ſuitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, a neceſſary Concomitant, and always to be preſum'd.</p>

                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:46380:80"/>But then becauſe they did not think it fit to faſt on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> no more than on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> unleſs only on the <hi>Saturday</hi> of <hi>Paſſion-Week;</hi> they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deducting their ſeven <hi>Sundays,</hi> and ſix <hi>Saturdays,</hi> faſted effectually no more than thirty ſix Days. Since that time, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, that they may in ſome ſort be nearer to the Number <hi>Forty,</hi> have added an <hi>Eighth Week</hi> of previous Abſtinence; beginning on thoſe five days to faſt from Fleſh, though they allow themſelves the uſe of <hi>Eggs,</hi> and <hi>Milk,</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> and <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> things from which in the ſeven following Weeks they ſtrictly forbear. And they beſides, for an Introduction to this whole Faſt, ſet apart another <hi>ninth Week,</hi> wherein they ſpecially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, by Confeſſion of their own Sins, and Forgiveneſs of the Sins of others againſt themſelves. This is the additional Practice of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And the <hi>Latines</hi> likewiſe have enlarg'd their <hi>Lent:</hi> and whereas before they rather adjuſted the <hi>ſpace</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> within which they kept their Faſt, than the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Days</hi> they did actually faſt, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Forty;</hi> (<hi>forty two</hi> being nearer to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46380:80"/>
                        <hi>Forty,</hi> than <hi>thirty ſix</hi>); they have ſince thought it better to make up the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Forty</hi> preciſely of ſuch <hi>fafling Days;</hi> and have therefore added <hi>Four</hi> to the former, beginning on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> of the ſeventh Week, as is well known.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ III. WHAT we have from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen</hi> is expreſs, and without Diſpute: what follows from <hi>Socrates</hi> is more confus'd and ambiguous, but may ſerve however to give us ſome light. He, writing at the ſame time with <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and taking the ſame occaſion from the <hi>Novatian</hi> difference, to enter upon the like Diſcourſe, ſays, among other things, (<hi>b</hi> 2) <hi>Thoſe of the ſame Faith differ in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages—The Faſt, for Example, before</hi> Eaſter <hi>is differently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in different places. For thoſe in</hi> Rome <hi>fast Three continued Weeks before</hi> Eaſter, <hi>except</hi> Saturdays <hi>and</hi> Sundays: <hi>But the</hi> Illyrians, <hi>and</hi> Grecians <hi>of</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>and</hi> Alexandrians <hi>keep a Faſt of Six Weeks before</hi> Eaſter, <hi>calling it the</hi> Forty Seaſon. <hi>And beſides theſe, there are others, who beginning ſeven Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and faſting by Intervals only Three Weeks of five Days a-piece, call that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46380:81"/>ſpace of Time nevertheleſs the</hi> Forty Seaſon. <hi>And I can't but wonder, how thoſe who differ ſo in the Number of the Days ſhould agree to give them that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Name, of which Denomination ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inquiſitive Men have given ſeveral Accounts. Neither is there a difference only about the Number of Days, but about the Abſtinence of their Diet. Some abſtain from all that has Life: ſome eat of no Animal but Fiſh; ſome of Birds too: ſome abſtain from Fruits and Eggs: ſome take only dry Bread; and ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not that: but others Eating not till Three in the Afternoon, after that uſe their Liberty. And infinite are the differences about theſe things; concerning which we have no written Precept: and thence it is plain, that they are left by the Apoſtles to every ones own Judgment and Choice; that every one may voluntarily do what is Good, not for Fear, or out of Neceſſity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Account of <hi>Socrates</hi> has been much queſtion'd in what relates to <hi>Rome:</hi> it being apparent from <hi>Sozomen</hi> and otherwiſe, That in that time not <hi>Three Weeks,</hi> but <hi>Six</hi> were obſerved in that City. He himſelf too afterwards
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46380:81"/>ſays, that they faſted there all <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> (as they are known to have done in that Age from other hands) except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that before <hi>Eaſter</hi> only. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for this has met with a very hard Cenſure from ſome: others have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſalve the Matter with new Readings: and <hi>Valeſius</hi> ſtands ſo much on his ſide, as to take up the Paradox, and juſtifie every Tittle, he is ſuppoſed to ſay, againſt all Opponents. But, it may be, the fairer way would be, not to underſtand him of the Practice of the Catholicks, of which <hi>Sozomen</hi> and others ſpeak; but of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> of whoſe Affairs all own that he had a particular Knowledge, if he was not inclined to their Sect. From their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it was, he enter'd upon this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and from ſome Memorials of theirs, he may have drawn up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Account; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might eaſily have been as plain and full as that of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> had it not been wrote in a different View. And ſo, if we ſuppoſe the Regard to Forty Days to have firſt prevail'd univerſally from the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> we may ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Novatians</hi> having
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46380:82"/>had no ſhare in that Council, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt at <hi>Rome</hi> in their old Cuſtom, and kept on their <hi>Three Weeks.</hi> If this Conjecture paſs for the <hi>Three Weeks.</hi> I ſhould then either think that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had not begun to faſt on <hi>Saturday,</hi> till after the <hi>Novatians</hi> had left them: Or that a Word, or rather a Numeral Letter <hi>(c)</hi> ſhould be ſupplied in the Original, and <hi>Thurſday</hi> be underſtood: a Day, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us <hi>(d),</hi> not commonly faſted in his Time, and poſſibly not in <hi>Lent</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Time of <hi>Novatian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">§. IV. BUT on this I lay no ſtreſs; and ſhall only take notice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark which <hi>Socrates</hi> makes with ſome Wonder, That Numbers of Days ſo different ſhould all have the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and be call'd from the Number <hi>Forty.</hi> It is plain, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Weſtern</hi> nor <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church of his Time did meaſure adequately ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Days they faſted, or the Term of Days within which they faſted, by the Number of <hi>Forty:</hi> but however a regard they had to it, and a <hi>Forty Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> they all pretended to keep. We
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46380:82"/>have withal ſeen how that Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obtain'd ſo much, that all ſpaces of Faſting, and in all Seaſons of the Year, were call'd by it. For ſo St. <hi>Jerome</hi> term'd the Two Faſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Montanus</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ch. 4. Note <hi>(g).</hi>
                        </note>: though they were but of a Week each of them, and in other times of the Year.</p>
                     <p>What Reaſons were then aſſigned for this Common Name, <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us not, and I wiſh we knew. It ſhould ſeem at firſt ſight, That the Chriſtians aſpired, in a Faſt of ſo great Devotion, to the Imitation of the moſt Solemn Faſts recorded in Scripture, thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and that particularly of their bleſſed Maſter. And then, when the Church had once fix'd upon that Number of Days for their Example in general; the Faſts of leſſer duration might well go under the ſame Name by an eaſie <hi>Metonymie.</hi> But all this will be yet more natural, if thoſe Faſts ſo recorded, were rather miraculous in the Manner, than ſingular in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Days; and the Number <hi>Forty</hi> had been always with the <hi>Jews</hi> the proper Number for an extraordinary Humiliation: a Conjecture we are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46380:83"/>to offer hereafter, in the other Part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. V. AND thus have we view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Practice of <hi>Lent</hi> through the firſt 400 Years. We have ſeen in the laſt of thoſe Centuries, when <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> came to be more openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed under the <hi>Chriſtian Emperours,</hi> and abounded in Writers, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and undeniable Teſtimonies of the general Obſervation, though in a different manner, of the <hi>Forty Seaſon,</hi> then commonly ſo called from Forty Days. In the next Age above it, the <hi>Third,</hi> and as high too as the middle of it, a time that affords us not many Authors, and when there was little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of this Matter; we have however a very punctual Account of their ſtrict Manner of keeping the <hi>Paſſion-Week,</hi> from one of the greateſt Men of the Church, who happen'd to be conſulted about a Nicety of Ending this <hi>Lent.</hi> And that their great Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> equal to any that was uſed after, may well induce us to imagine, That theſe Men had not left the Devotion of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46380:83"/>Weeks to be added by the very next Generation: Eſpecially when we find the <hi>Forty Seaſon</hi> expreſly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Origen,</hi> a Maſter of this <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> as conſecrated to Faſting. For that place of <hi>Origen,</hi> though we have it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Verſion of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and he none of the moſt exact Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; yet certainly if he was not the worſt that ever was, is much more likely to be truly render'd than wrong: there being no reaſon to faſten the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity on this Word, more than on any other of the Sentence; nor any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to find that ſpoke of now, which not long after was celebrated ſo much. But to proceed, we have ſeen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> an Author to be reckon'd to the Second Century as well as to the Third, that the Days in which our Lord was taken away, <hi>Good-Friday</hi> and the <hi>Holy Saturday</hi> at leaſt, if not the whole Week, were in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of his Time, to be faſted by all from Apoſtolical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that no other Days were to be faſted neceſſarily, and as by Divine Precept, but at Diſcretion only, and as Chriſtians ſhould think fit in Godly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46380:84"/>Prudence. Upon the account of which Diſcretionary Uncertainty, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was engag'd in made it not proper for him to ſay any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, nor to tell us the ſeveral Cuſtoms of ſeveral Churches about that Arbitrary part of <hi>Lent:</hi> though it may otherwiſe be collected, even from him, that there was then ſuch an Additional Time obſerved. But to go yet higher, and nearer to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Age; about the Year 190, and not 90 from the Death of St. <hi>John, Irenaeus a</hi> Venerable, and now a very Old Biſhop, who had converſed fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with the great <hi>Polycarp,</hi> as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi> had with St. <hi>John</hi> and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, has happened to let us know, though incidentally only, the various obſervation of his Time; that ſome thought they ought to faſt <hi>One,</hi> ſome <hi>Two,</hi> and ſome <hi>More</hi> Days, and ſome <hi>Forty:</hi> as we have learn'd too in the general, both from him and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of almoſt the whole Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currently with him, that ſome ſuch <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te-Paſchal Fast</hi> had been all along ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all Places, up to the Time of the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>

<hi>AN ESSAY Concerning the ORIGINAL OF LENT,</hi> Subdivided into Two Repartitions: The <hi>Firſt</hi> Shewing preparatorily, That moſt of the Ancient Chriſtian Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were deriv'd from the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> Conjecturing, That <hi>Lent</hi> is of the ſame Original.</head>
                  <p>HAving view'd the Ancient Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Lent,</hi> we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to enquire into its Original: and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46380:87"/>concerning That, the Conjectures are various. Some aſcribe its Riſe to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Conſtitution; ſome to caſual Practice, imitated and enlarged by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the one ſuppoſing forty Days to be the preſcribed Number, and that thoſe who faſted ſewer were deficient; others imagining, That one Day only, the Day of the Paſſion, was firſt kept by the Grief, rather than Devotion, of ſome good Chriſtians, and that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards grew to that large number of Days by the Piety, if not Superſtition, of following Ages: all agreeing in this, That it was a novel Inſtitution at the earlieſt, being wholly Chriſtian, and having no Precedent from any former Uſage. Now to theſe Conjectures not ſeeming to be very ſatisfactory, I have adventured to add another, drawn from the Cuſtom of the Jews, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Great Faſt, and their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Preparation before it: hoping if it appears reaſonably well grounded, that it may help to give a clearer light, as well as a better colour, to a Seaſon ſo much and ſo long obſerv'd in the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>And here I intended at firſt to have entered immediately upon the View of the Expiation-Day of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Preparatory Seaſon, comparing them with our Expiation, the Paſſion-Day, and its previous <hi>Lent:</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, if I miſtake not, is ſo exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, as to make one apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at the firſt ſight, that one of thoſe Lines was drawn by the other. But becauſe I am ſenſible that ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may be raiſed, both againſt the Deſign it ſelf, and the Authorities I am to uſe; I ſhall endeavour firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them: and poſſibly by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers I am to give, I may not only ſmooth the way; but make ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as may bring us at the ſame time nearer to the Admittance of what I have propoſed.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Three Prejudices,</hi> I foreſee, which may encounter this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The <hi>firſt</hi> may be, That it is not probable the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> would imitate the <hi>Jews,</hi> or fit they ſhould:</item>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:46380:88"/>
                     <item>2. The <hi>other,</hi> That the Traditional Writings they have, are not ſufficient Authority for the Knowledge of their ancient Cuſtoms:</item>
                     <item>3. And the <hi>laſt</hi> may be this: That ſuch a Derivation of <hi>Lent</hi> muſt be falſe, becauſe it is new.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Three Prejudices</hi> have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Addition of the firſt Member of this Part, and the Reader, if he pleaſes, may paſs it over. But of Thoſe the Two laſt will be eaſily ſatisfied by the Conſideration of the Firſt, and upon that Subject I ſhall enlarge the more freely, becauſe it may be as delightful and inſtructive to obſerve the Original of many other Chriſtian Inſtitutions, as of <hi>Lent.</hi>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46380:89"/>rejected the Moſaical Law, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed its God. And there may be many now (though more innocent) who at this diſtance from the Riſe of Chriſtianity, may either have loſt the Remembrance of its Original, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that the laſt Covenant has any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the firſt: or elſe in Pride of our greater Priviledges, may ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully over-look the Diſpenſation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> as a beggarly Element; and in the Vanity of a Neighbour-Nation, may think it a Diſparagement to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, to be thought of Jewiſh Extraction. And there may ſeem to have been more cauſe given for this Conceit, from ſome learned Books of late, which have treated concerning the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and which have been miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo far by ſome to the Prejudice of the old Teſtament, that thoſe who have not conſidered the Matter well, may look upon it as very diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſtianity, to borrow any thing from that Nation, which is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have borrowed ſo much of all its Neighbours, and to have robb'd even the Religion of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:46380:89"/>But they need not fear; for Truth can never ſuffer from Truth: and if it ſhall indeed appear, that the Moſaick Religion was conformable to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Neighbours; It may notwithſtanding no leſs main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Divine Authority. Knowledge, we know, as well as Empire, began in that part of the World; and there the many Traditions concerning God, deſcended from <hi>Noah</hi> and others of his inſpired Sons, were lodged and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: blended, we may think, and much corrupted with many Falſities and Superſtitions; variouſly too by its various Depoſitaries, the <hi>Chaldeans, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, Phoenicians, Arabians,</hi> &amp;c. Now all Theſe had ſomething of the ſame Religion, as they had of the ſame Language, but in a different Dialect and Manner: and what if God was pleaſed, by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to reform it from the many Additions, impious or immoral, with which it had been ſeverally adulterated, Retaining ſome indifferent Cuſtoms innocently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, Inſtituting others in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the more dangerous Errours, and directing ſome eminent Parts of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46380:90"/>the whole to a further Proſpect of another and more perfect Revelation yet to come; and all theſe Laws, for the Uſe of a Peculiar People, to reduce into <hi>one Code,</hi> and authorize by a new Sanction.</p>
                     <p>Such a Reformed Religion, we may ſuppoſe that of the <hi>Jews</hi> to have been; and need not therefore be afraid, if our Religion be ſaid to be a further Reformation of that <hi>Judaiſm:</hi> a Title Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> frequently gives it, but to be underſtood, not as if it were a Repur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Old from any Errour, but as it is the Completion and Perfection of it according to the Original Deſign. And as certainly as our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles were of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage, ſo certain it is, that our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grafted on the <hi>Jewiſh.</hi> Neither do the Expreſſions only and Alluſions of the Goſpel relate to the Cuſtoms of the Law, not well otherwiſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: but ſome of its chief Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are known to be derived thence. For as before, many of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Rites were unqueſtionably deſign'd to preſignifie our Saviour; ſo ſome of them were afterwards taken into his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46380:90"/>Service, always to miniſter unto him: not admitted only for the preſent, out of condeſcenſion to the Native or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Number of Converts conſiſted; but ſome formally adopted, and others laudably continued, for Perpetuity. This has in part been already copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly demonſtrated by many very Learned Writers: and if any thing ſhall chance to be added by me, I offer it with all ſubmiſſion. And indeed it would not be pertinent to my Buſineſs, to pretend in this Matter to any new Diſcoveries; who am rather now, by ſuch Obſervations as are well Agreed and Received, to try to favour ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gueſs, I am by and by to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
                     <p>But beſides, to be honeſt to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and withal to put him out of any fear; I am here to profeſs, That I pretend not to the Depths of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudical</hi> Learning, nor intend to engage him in it: having never dug in the dark Mine my ſelf, but only ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which has been brought above ground by others, and expoſed to common Uſe, either in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46380:91"/>of the <hi>Miſnah,</hi> or of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> (for of him I have not read much more than is in <hi>Latin</hi>) or in the Works of modern Authors.</p>
                     <p>The Reader therefore will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go on and ſee how much of the Chriſtian Appointments appears to have been copied from the <hi>Jewiſh.</hi> And here he will preſently find it agreed by all, That the <hi>Two Sacraments</hi> were taken thence; That the <hi>Weekly Obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> was in Imitation of their <hi>Sabbath;</hi> That the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> came from the <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> And that the <hi>Apoſtles, Preſbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> were <hi>Officers</hi> after their Model. But beſides theſe <hi>Principal Ordinances,</hi> which are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> he will find too, That many <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> which in the ſecond Age attended thoſe <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> were likewiſe <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> as well as many other <hi>

                     <p>In the firſt place, They mingled a Cup of Wine to every one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and the Maſter of the Family praiſing God the Creatour of the Fruit of the Vine; [in the ordinary Form which they uſe at other Meals]; He and they all drank: beginning ſo, and conſecrating the Paſchal Action, which they were going now to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46380:96"/>the Table was ſet, furniſh'd with bitter and ſweet Herbs, unleavened Bread, a Sauce red like Brick, and the <hi>Body of the Lamb,</hi> [for that is their manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,] together with the Fleſh of the ſolemn Peace-Offering, [which was to be offer'd on ſome day of the Feaſt<note n="(e)" place="margin">Deut. 16.2.</note>, and was commonly ſacrifc'd on this Day in the Morning<note n="(f)" place="margin">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46380:97"/>Lamb in his hands, and Elevating it, propos'd to himſelf the Queſtion, Why it was offer'd, and gave the Reaſon. And ſo he elevated ſeverally both the bitter Herbs, and the unleavened Bread; and after all the ſeveral Reaſons given, he ſubjoin'd a Hymn, <hi>Let us therefore celebrate, praiſe, extol—him, who has done ſo many and ſo great, and ſuch ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Wonders— To Him let us ſing Hellelujah, Praiſe the LORD, ye Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the LORD—:</hi> concluding ſo, <hi>Thanks be to thee, O GOD, King of the World, who didſt redeem us and our Anceſtors, and haſt brought us to this Night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here they all drank again, in the ſame manner as at firſt, and waſh'd again likewiſe; [here again beginning their Supper.] For then he took two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Cakes, and dividing one, he put one half of it over the other Cake; [the half Cake being, as they ſay, to remember them of their former Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]: and ſo ſaid over the Bread a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. After he dipp'd a piece of the Cake, with ſome of the bitter Herbs, in the Sauce, and eat; having bleſſed God with a proper Prayer; [and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46380:97"/>to the reſt to eat likewiſe.] So with a proper Prayer they taſted of the Peace-Offering; and with another, of the Lamb: and after they fed freely of what was before them. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly each was bound at the cloſe of the Supper, to end with ſome of the Lamb; eating the Quantity of an Olive at leaſt: [as they now do with a piece of one of the half Cakes, which they ſubſtitute in place of the Lamb.]</p>
                     <p>When they had done eating, they waſh'd their hands: and each having a third Cup diſtributed to them, the Maſter having ſaid over it the Grace after Meat, [and it is term'd thence the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing,</hi>] they drank it off. And then there was another, the fourth Cup, put into their hands; and the Hymn being re-continued, with its proper Concluſion, they again thanking God for the Fruit of the Vine, drank that alſo; and after that no more that night: [it being now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards midnight, and they being after this to meditate yet on their Paſchal Deliverance].</p>
                     <p>Thus, according to the Tradition of the Jews, the Paſchal Supper was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46380:98"/>while the Temple ſtood: and ever ſince it has been kept much after the ſame manner, though the Paſchal Lamb has been wanting. And poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, (if I might be allow'd to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Gueſs in this matter,) this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per might have been obſerv'd, as now it is, without the Sacrifice, even when the Temple was in being; by ſuch as after the firſt Diſperſions by the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings, continued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in remote Parts; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to keep the Feaſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by reaſon of their Diſtance, were how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever willing to keep up the ſolemn Memorial of that great Deliverance, in the beſt manner they cou'd, and as it is now done.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. II. NOW to this Account the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Paſchal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per agrees. The <hi>Cup</hi> mention'd by St. <hi>Luke</hi>

And laſtly, the <hi>Cup after Supper,</hi> the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> as it is call'd by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in expreſs Terms<note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>, what ſhould it be, but what the Jews call by that name, and with which they thank for the Meal, the third Cup? Neither becauſe our Saviour ſays in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">26.29.</note> after the Cup, that <hi>he would not henceforth drink any more of the fruit of the vine;</hi> will it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he did not drink the fourth Cup. For the ſame Saying is put in St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Luke 22.18.</note> before the firſt Cup; and can there ſignifie no otherwiſe than in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that after that Solemnity was wholly over, he would not drink of it: except we will ſuppoſe, that what he gave to the Diſciples, he took not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But however this may be, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath yet one farther Particular, agreeable to the Deſcription of the Jews: That when they had ſupp'd, <hi>they ſung a Hymn,</hi> and <hi>went out to the Mount of Olives</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Matth. 26.30.</note> [to meditate]. And it has beſides been obſerv'd, that our Saviour, when he ſpoke the <hi>Bread</hi> to be <hi>his Body,</hi> might have had a peculiar reſpect to that Phraſe of the <hi>Body of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46380:99"/>the Lamb:</hi> and could it be admitted that in thoſe days, as now, an unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd Cake was by any ſubſtituted for the <hi>Body of the Lamb;</hi> It might then have been the eaſier underſtood, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our <hi>Lord's Body.</hi> Theſe are the particular Correſpondencies, between the Paſchal and the Lord's Supper: and there was too another general one in their Nature; as they were both of them to be Memorials of a former bloody Atonement; Feaſts of preſent Joy and Thanks, but not without ſome afflictive Remembrance for the Paſt.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore it appears, and from the Relation of the Scripture, that our Lord thought fit to raiſe his other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment likewiſe out of a Feſtival Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, the Jews were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to keep for their old Deliverance. And hereafter it will appear further, by the Conſtruction the Primitive Church made, that our Saviour in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Feaſt, did not conſider only that ſingle Annual Solemnity of theirs, but their other more frequent Sacrifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Entertainments of Praiſe and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving<note n="(o)" place="margin">See <hi>C. 7.</hi> of this Repartit.</note>.</p>

                     <p>THE Two Sacraments, we ſee, as they are deſcribed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, appear to have been transferr'd from the Old Teſtament to the New; and by the one of them we are Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Chriſtian Covenant, and by the other we Recognize it.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46380:100"/>a like Body, and with like Officers, we ſhall next inquire, and from Scriptural Authority.</p>
                     <p n="1">§. I. And firſt, It is plain that the Church of Chriſt comes into the place of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For it is known that the Word in the New Teſtament, which we Tranſlate <hi>Church,</hi> is the ſame with that which ſtands in the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Old for the <hi>Congregation</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> of that People: and as they had <hi>Moſes</hi> for their Leader and Law-giver under God, their King, and alſo Chief Prieſt, (for he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons;) ſo are we a Society or Body united in One Head, our Lord Jeſus, who under the Father is our King, and High Prieſt.

THIS his People, Our Prince and High-Prieſt himſelf ſtill Governs; but by ſuch ſubordinate Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers below, as are denominated from the Jews; and alſo with the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; as far as was conſiſtent with his Empire, which was to be neither Local nor Temporal, not dependent upon any one place, nor regarding Worldly Intereſts.</p>
                     <p>The Officers of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> mentioned in the Scripture, are <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Biſhops, Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> and what ſignification ſuch Titles did bear in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we are now to ſee.

                     <p>The higheſt Office of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is that of the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> and it is a term of large ſignification, both

With the Jews there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Miniſter of the Synagogue, who takes care of the Buſineſs of it under the Superiour Governours, and reads the Prayers, and who is call'd now more commonly <hi>Chazan</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">See §. VI.</note>; is alſo known by this Name, as being the Deputy of the Congregation.

But however, it is certain from <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that it was the Name of ſuch Plenipotentiary-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, as were ſent by the chief of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46380:101"/>the Jews, the High-Prieſt, or Patriarch, not only to gather Money, but to viſit and reform a Province, and to confirm and diſplace its Officers: For ſo he ſays <hi>(d)</hi> of one <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who was <hi>ſent</hi> with that Power, <hi>from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, then reſiding in</hi> Paleſtine <hi>into</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia; <hi>that he brought back to him the Tenths, and Firſt Fruits of the Province; and beſides had diſplac'd there many of their Rulers of the Synagogues, and of their Prieſts, and of their Elders, and of their</hi> Azanites, <hi>which are their Deacons or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi> And before (<hi>d</hi> 2) Apoſtles are deſcrib'd to be <hi>Men of great Authority, who are Aſſeſſors to the Patriarch.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The other, the <hi>Limited Elders,</hi> were either ſuch as had Power to be of one of the inferiour Conſiſtories of Three in leſſer Diſtricts, and to Judge only of Pecuniary Cauſes; or ſuch who were not capable of Juriſdiction, and could only expound the Law; or elſe who were not qualified to direct in the whole Law, but were confin'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes.</p>
                     <p>To this Office of Elderſhip they were ordain'd by Impoſition of Hands, with Words ſignifying the Authority committed; or elſe by Letter-Patent, or Miſſive.

                     <p>And the Truth is, according to the Modern Traditions, thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were not ſo abſolute in the Temple, nor of that conſideration out of the Temple, as they ſeem to have been by the Scripture, and by <hi>Joſephus.</hi> And now at this time, though the Prieſts receive ſometimes ſome little due for the Redemption of the Firſt-Born, and are call'd before others to Read the Law, and are preferr'd to give the Solemn Bleſſing in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and to ſay Grace at Meals; yet for the reſt they are as common <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> and under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> For theſe <hi>Rabbins</hi> have order'd the Matter ſo, that they are reputed, to Repreſent the Prieſts, and to ſucceed into their Sacerdotal Right, claiming therefore to be free from Taxes, and from Watch and Ward, to have the Prevendition or Pre-emption in the Market, and to have their

                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Act. 6.</note>, Ordain'd by the Apoſtles with Impoſition of hands.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were <hi>Men of Honest Report,</hi> who were to eaſe the Apoſtles of the Adminiſtration of the Charitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Church; not to be <hi>Gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> of the Basket, I ſuppoſe, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

                     </p>
                     <p>For though the Greek word for <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring,</hi> does ſometimes ſignify, to <hi>wait</hi> and <hi>ſerve at a Table;</hi> yet, as we juſt now noted, it is by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to that low ſenſe; but is ſaid as well of the Office of our Bleſſed Lord, and of his Apoſtles, and alſo of Kings; that is, of any the Nobleſt Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and may therefore anſwer the word <hi>Parnas,</hi> in its Higheſt meaning.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it at all neceſſary, that the Office of a <hi>Deacon</hi> ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oeconomical; becauſe it was firſt erected in the Chriſtian Church, on that occaſion. While the whole Church was yet but as one Family, under the immediate Government of the Apoſtles, and they had not yet Created any other Officers; the firſt Officers were indeed inſtituted upon the firſt emergent want, and were order'd then eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to take care of that, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the publick expence: but they were alſo to be, as we may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46380:115"/>ſubſervient to the Apoſtles in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>adminiſtrations,</hi> and to Publiſh and Execute all their Orders. For the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of them was, to be <hi>full of the Holy Ghost and Wiſdom:</hi> and certainly a <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> beyond that of common managery; and a <hi>Spirit,</hi> more than Oeconomical, was then underſtood. Though therefore thoſe Deacons were not to <hi>give themſelves up to Prayer and the word</hi> only; yet they might have had their part even in thoſe Functions: as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> we find had; whoſe Preaching the Scripture records, more than his Good Husbandry; and who <hi>ſpeaking by</hi> that <hi>Wiſdom and Spirit,</hi> for which he was but now choſen into his Office, became the firſt <hi>Martyr,</hi> as well as firſt <hi>Deacon,</hi> of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Deacons, it ſhould ſeem, were Extraordinary; attending Miniſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Apoſtles, as upon the <hi>twelve Princes of Iſrael:</hi> having been created before the appointment of any Biſhops, or Subaltern Presbyters. But afterwards in every City where Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Presbyters were plac'd, the Officers of this Order were conſtantly ſubjoin'd. So the Epiſtle to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi>

                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.8.</note>. And there, we may obſerve, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of the lower Office, are near the ſame with thoſe of the Higher, and as much almoſt requir'd in the Deacon: enough to induce us to think, that ſome Spiritual Duty was alſo to be diſcharg'd by Him.</p>
                     <p>So much Reaſon there is from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to conclude, that Chriſtian Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons did not only <hi>Keep and Diſpenſe</hi> the Publick Contributions, as the <hi>Jewiſh Parnaſim;</hi> but that they ſerv'd under their Superiors even in the <hi>Miniſtery of the Word and Prayer:</hi> as we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find them hereafter<note n="(f)" place="margin">Chap.

                     <p>Indeed there was with the <hi>Jews</hi> a kind of Cenſure, called by them a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke (a),</hi> which, from the Mouth of a Grave Perſon pronounc'd for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed before him, had that Force, as to ſhame the <hi>Delinquent,</hi> and oblige him to his good Behaviour, and a particular Modeſty, for the ſpace of <hi>Seven Days.</hi> But this was a <hi>Reproof,</hi> rather than a <hi>Sentence;</hi> and ſeems to have oblig'd in <hi>good Manners</hi> only: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it reſtrain the Party from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Converſe:</hi> or needed any Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be given, but expired at the end of the Week.</p>

                     <p>And as for his other Aſſertion, That Excommunication did not operate in the Synagogue or the Temple; it is both very ſtrange, and, I believe, not well founded.</p>
                     <p>Strange it is at the firſt ſight, that thoſe who were ſeparated from their Brethren as <hi>unclean,</hi> in all Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſhould freely mingle in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; and ſhould be allowed to tread on their Heels in the Synagogues, from whom they were to keep ſuch a diſtance in the Streets. And very ſtrange it is, that thoſe who were eſteem'd as <hi>Lepers,</hi> much more thoſe who were <hi>cut off</hi> from the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould be admitted into the Temple, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly allowed to worſhip in that Holy Place in the Company of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People. Though all this might not ſeem ſo ſtrange, when Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> wrote; then when People were privileged in the Houſes of God, from ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Ceremony, as they obſerved in their own Houſes, and in the Streets.</p>
                     <p>But this peremptory Aſſertion is not only Suſpicious, but Erroneous. And as to the Synagogue, I have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Affirmation of <hi>Leo de Modena</hi> (an

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs.</hi> Into the <hi>Second</hi> [B], neither <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor the <hi>Defil'd</hi> with <hi>Dead,</hi> could enter: but thoſe might, who were <hi>waſh'd</hi> for <hi>Leſſer Defilements</hi> which <hi>polluted</hi> but for a <hi>Day,</hi> and waited only for <hi>Sun-Set</hi> to be <hi>perfectly clean.</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> [C], was what was call'd the <hi>Court of the Women,</hi> and into it the <hi>laſt mention'd</hi> could not come: but <hi>they</hi> who were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <hi>Purified,</hi> and only wanted to be <hi>Expiated</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> might. The <hi>Fourth</hi> [D], was the <hi>Court of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> for thoſe who were <hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Perfect.</hi> Beyond this there was a <hi>Fifth</hi> [E], for the <hi>Sons of Levi:</hi> and then, laſtly, a <hi>Sixth</hi> [F]; where the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46380:127"/>
                        <hi>Altar</hi> [G] <hi>ſtood,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were <hi>made,</hi> juſt before the <hi>Porch</hi> [H] of the <hi>Houſe</hi> [I K].</p>
                     <p>And now what ſort of Argument is this, that the <hi>excommunicated Iſraelite</hi> was not debarr'd the Liberty of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping in the Temple; becauſe he was admitted into the <hi>Outmoſt Court,</hi> and where a <hi>Gentile</hi> might come as well? Whereas, for ought appears, he might be ſuffer'd to go no further; and might be kept off at the Diſtance of <hi>Three Courts</hi> from the Place of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Devotion. But how much leſs will this avail for an Argument, if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Perſon there ſpoken of was not one of the <hi>more guilty</hi> ſort, or not of that kind which are compared with the <hi>Leper,</hi> much leſs of thoſe who are wholly <hi>Cut off</hi> from the People of GOD?</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding therefore this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s, the Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the Practice of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue would hold good for the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and on that I might reſt: but there are other very probable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that will concur to exclude
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46380:128"/>the <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> at leaſt, from any near Approach in the Temple.</p>
                     <p>For tho' <hi>Excommunicates</hi> are not at all reckon'd by <hi>Maimonides</hi> in this place, and thoſe only are mentioned here whom the Law pronounces <hi>unclean;</hi> yet we may ſuppoſe that theſe were nam'd only for Example ſake, and that other States of Men lay under the ſame Reſtriction.</p>
                     <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> it appears from the ſame Author <hi>(g),</hi> that none was to come into the <hi>Court of the Iſraelites</hi> in an <hi>uncomely Dreſs,</hi> with <hi>torn Clothes,</hi> or <hi>long neglected Hair.</hi> By which it is plain, That <hi>Mourners</hi> were not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enter there during the whole <hi>Thirty Days;</hi> and conſequently that <hi>all Excommunicates</hi> were likewiſe debarr'd thence.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>further,</hi> of the <hi>Mourners</hi> of the <hi>firſt ſeven Days,</hi> he elſewhere <hi>(h)</hi> tells us, That they <hi>ſent no Offerings to the Altar, not ſo much as Wine, or Wood, or Frankincenſe:</hi> [not for their <hi>Sins,</hi> and leſs of <hi>Peace,</hi> and much leſs of <hi>Thanks.</hi>] By this <hi>Prohibition</hi> of <hi>Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> it is imply'd, They could not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46380:128"/>
                        <hi>come:</hi> and ſeeing it is the ſame <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> which lay upon the <hi>Defil'd with the Dead;</hi> we may conclude, That theſe <hi>Mourners</hi> likewiſe were oblig'd to ſtop with them in the <hi>Outer Court,</hi> and could not paſs beyond.</p>
                     <p>Now that there were <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> who anſwer'd theſe <hi>Mourners,</hi> we have ſeen<note n="(i)" place="margin">§. II.</note>; and that they kept them company there in the <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> we might well preſume. But the <hi>Excommunicates</hi> happen in this Caſe to be mention'd by our Author: and in a manner, that though it may ſeem to weaken the Inference, will be found to confirm it. It is ſaid there <hi>(k)</hi> of the <hi>Excommunicates, That it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether they might ſend;</hi> and alſo that <hi>if they did ſend, the Oblation would be good.</hi> And if this Place would have concluded any thing for their Freedom of Acceſs, or for their Advantage from thoſe Sacrifices; it would not have been omitted by Mr. <hi>Selden:</hi> whereas he rather ſeems to have paſs'd it by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he foreſaw it would make againſt him. For he knew well that the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> being <hi>good,</hi> ſignified no more than that (though it were regularly to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46380:129"/>be forborn, yet) the Reception of it by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> was no Prophanation <hi>(k):</hi> and he could not but diſcern, That this Unlawfulneſs of <hi>Sending</hi> impli'd the Unlawfulneſs of their <hi>Coming;</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe no ſuch Doubt could have been made concerning them.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> As for thoſe <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates,</hi> who were rank'd with <hi>Lepers,</hi> or who were abſolutely <hi>Cutt off;</hi> it cannot but ſeem probable, That theſe were denied <hi>Entrance</hi> not into the <hi>Temple</hi> only, but even into the <hi>Holy City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The contrary therefore to what Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſo often aſſerts is very evident, That no <hi>Excommunicate Perſon</hi> could go into the <hi>Court of the Iſraelites,</hi> and that many of them could go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <hi>Outmost Court:</hi> and it appears to be very likely, That thoſe who lay under the more grievous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, were utterly excluded even from the Privileges of a <hi>pious Heathen.</hi> This diſtance They themſelves were oblig'd in Conſcience to keep: and if any of them were ſuffered by the <hi>Priests</hi> to come nearer; it muſt have been from the Want, either of Authority in the

And, I ſuppoſe, as he was not admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Approbation of the Conſiſtory, ſo not without the Privity of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, that any perſon might have the opportunity and liberty to object
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46380:140"/>in the caſe of a new Member, as they had in caſe of an Officer <hi>(b).</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When too this Proſelyte of the Jews came to the Baptiſtery, or place of Water, he had the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> put to him again, as we are told expreſly; and upon that was dipp'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here the Parallel is very clear, as we have ſeen before<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ch. 2. ſect. 2.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Further, I would with the Reader's leave offer a gueſs, that the Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made too by the Jew, towards <hi>One Point</hi> of the Compaſs; and that he after turn'd to the contrary, and ſo enter'd the Water. For it is certain, when he was once from under the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was become a Jew, he had then for ever afterwards a new Point of Direction impreſs'd, and in all his Devotions was to turn his Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Holy Temple<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Maim.</hi> Tract. de Precibus, cap. 5. ſect. 3.</note>. Nor is it unlikely therefore that he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that Poſition, when he enter'd upon that Sacred Action; and that taking his leave of the oppoſite part of the World, he took care to riſe up with that Proſpect before him: after the manner of the Jews their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, when they were baptiz'd again
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46380:141"/>in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and paſs'd through it to the Holy-Land.</p>
                     <p>In like manner I am apt to think, that the proſelyted Jew taſted of <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Honey;</hi> both as it was the firſt Food of a New-born Infant, and the Product of the Land into which he was now naturaliz'd. Neither let it be thought that ſuch Conjectures beg the Queſtion; and that where I ſhould prove a Parallel, I only fancy it. For as ſoon as we know that this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for Example, was in uſe ſo early in the World; we cannot but obſerve, that it was very proper for the Jews, more proper for them than for Chriſtians: and that therefore in all likelihood it was rather invented by them, from whom the Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly borrow'd many other remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Circumſtances of the ſame Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with whom ſuch Ceremonies as theſe abounded. And no queſtion, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> inform us of many a Rite, of which the old Teſtament ſpeaks not a little; ſo there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, which they have paſs'd by, and left in Oblivion, even in Subjects of which they expreſly treat; and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46380:141"/>much more in this of Proſelytiſm, on which the <hi>Talmudical Treatiſe</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> informs me<note n="(e)" place="margin">De jure Nat. &amp; Gent. Sec. Hebr. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>5</hi> ſub finem.</note>. But of this particular Rite we ſhall much leſs wonder, that the Uſe of it with the Jews is forgot; when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that were it not for ſome few Writers, there would have been no footſtep of its Practice left amongſt us Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>§. V. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I proceed to the Seal of this Baptiſmal Action, its <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;</hi> and ſhall again offer to the Reader the probability of its corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Jewiſh Rites on the ſame occaſion.</p>
                     <p>It will be eaſily imagin'd, that this New Convert, who was now become an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and had the Title to all the Honours and Privileges of it, would make haſte to be put into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Greateſt, the Admiſſion into the Holy Temple, and to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip of God: Neither will the Reader think, after ſo much Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony us'd upon this Proſelyte before, that this laſt Act of introducing him
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46380:142"/>into the Houſe of God, was without its ſhare of Formality.</p>
                     <p>And that there was to be a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Jewiſh Baptiſm, we know already in groſs: and alſo in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that it was perform'd by a Burnt-Offering, joyn'd moſt ordinarily with a Peace-Offering, the Proſelyte ſprinkled with the Blood<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ch. 2. ſect. 2. as afore.</note>: but other Circumſtances of that Action I do not find; and beg the Reader's leave again to conjecture at them from other ſimilary caſes.</p>
                     <p>For, firſt, a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> new baptiz'd, and purg'd from all his former Sin, and admitted to the number of <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> but not yet receiv'd into their Station in God's Houſe, was very like to a <hi>Leper,</hi> recover'd from the <hi>Plague</hi> of his <hi>Leproſy,</hi> (which with the Jews reſembles a Sinful Life) whoſe Fleſh was as that of a Child; and who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now purg'd and waſh'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd thereby to the Society of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> was at the diſtance of ſeven days to be readmitted into his former place in the Temple. And that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity was perform'd in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46380:142"/>manner, as we know both from the Scripture and <hi>Maimonides</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Lib. de Sacr. Iract. <hi>5.</hi> Cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note>. The clean <hi>Leper</hi> being again waſh'd in the Court of the Women, and come up to the Door of the next Court, the Court of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> offer'd there a Sin, and a Treſpaſs, and a Burnt-Offering; and was then anointed with the Blood of the Sin-Offering on the tip of his Ear, on the Thumb and great Toe of his right ſide.

                     <p>And further, the <hi>Purification of a Proſelyte</hi> to come near to God into that Court, was ſomething of the ſame nature with the <hi>Conſecrution of a Prieſt,</hi> which was nothing elſe but his Purification to come nearer yet, and to paſs into another Court: and how that was done we learn from <hi>Leviticus</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Lev. 8.</note>. There was firſt a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock offer'd for their Sins, and a Burnt-Offering; and then after a Peace-Offering, with the Blood of which <hi>Aaron and his Sons</hi> were <hi>anointed,</hi> in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46380:143"/>the ſame parts in which the <hi>Lepers</hi> were. After this, with a mixture of that Blood and the Holy Oyntment, they and their Clothes were ſprinkled. And beſides, on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> (if not on his Son's too) the Holy Oyntment was poured; and on his <hi>Forehead</hi> (as the <hi>Rabbins</hi>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46380:144"/>was, in this like the Baptiſm of a Proſelyte, not to be reiterated, and ſuppos'd to deſcend down upon them from their firſt Progenitors. The Kings alſo of the Jews, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, were anointed with an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not of the Holy Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thoſe only, according to their Tradition, who were the Firſt of their Race, or under a queſtion'd Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note n="(k)" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now then, as the <hi>Leper</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> were Purified much after the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and as the Caſe of a <hi>Proſelyre</hi> agrees with either of them, ſo I am willing to ſuppoſe that his Purification was perform'd in a mix'd manner, betwixt thoſe us'd to the other two.</p>
                     <p>The Offerings for Sin us'd to both of them, a new-born Proſelyte did not want; and he therefore might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by <hi>Oyntment,</hi> as both of them were, either alone, or mix'd with the Blood of the Burnt-Offering; which Oyntment might neither be ſimple Oyl, nor was it to be of the Holy Sort, but of another kind, as that for Royal Inaugurations was. The Oyntment was pour'd <hi>on the Heads</hi> of <hi>the Leper</hi>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:46380:144"/>and <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and alſo of their <hi>Kings:</hi> and ſo, I ſuppoſe, it was upon the <hi>Head of the Proſelyte,</hi> after ſome parts of him had likewiſe been anointed with it before. For, as he was clean from the ſinful Leproſy of his former ſtate, ſo he was now admitted to be one of that Holy Nation a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom of Prieſts:</hi> and therefore, I preſume, the Oyntment on his Head was accordingly on his <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> drawn in ſome ſuch Figure as might mark him to be <hi>Holy to God.</hi> And after all, it cannot be doubted but that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> laid his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and bleſſed him; that God might liſt up the <hi>Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and his Holy Spirit might reſt upon him. And if this was perform'd upon a Proſelyte, probably it was not all to be done by an ordinary <hi>Prieſt;</hi> but the Proſelytiſm was confirm'd by the leave and direction of the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> or his <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> and the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> at leaſt receiv'd from a ſuperior Hand.</p>
                     <p>I again confeſs, that this Rubrick of Jewiſh <hi>Confirmation</hi> is drawn from Conjecture: but we are ſure of our
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46380:145"/>Ground, having their Authority, that there was actually ſuch a <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a Jewiſh Proſelyte: and we had reaſon, from the Agreement in other parts of this great Ceremony, to preſume it here. We know too, that Things and Perſons were <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruted by Oyntment,</hi> as well as by Blood; that the <hi>Oyntment</hi> was us'd alone to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and apart to the <hi>Leper;</hi> and that the <hi>Forehead</hi> was the place with them for a <hi>Mark</hi> of the Name of <hi>God,</hi> which all the <hi>Faithful</hi> were ſuppos'd to wear.</p>
                     <p>Tho' therefore we have no expreſs account left us of this Proceeding, yet we have reaſon to ſurmiſe it; and not only from the Practice I have given of the Jews in ſimilary caſes, but from frequent Alluſions to ſuch Particulars as theſe made in the New Teſtament.

For as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> new Baptiz'd omitted not to partake of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the next morning; ſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſelytes added ordinarily to their Holocauſt a <hi>Peace-Offering</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46380:150"/>reſpect it was in ſome ſort an <hi>Offering of Peace;</hi> obtaining not only Pardon, but Favour for Men.</p>
                     <p>And further, as the ſucceeding Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Sacrifices, tho' commemoratory of the Firſt, yet vary'd ſomething from it; being chiefly of an Euchariſtical nature, and not perform'd with the ſame Ceremony; (for neither was the Blood ſprinkl'd upon the Doors of the Offerers; neither was the Lamb eaten with their Staves in their Hand, and in a travelling poſture<note n="(c)" place="margin">Maim. <hi>de Sacrif. Paſch.</hi> cap. &amp; ſect. ult.</note>:) ſo it is not to be wonder'd if the ſucceeding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorations of our Lord's Sacrifice, tho' it was chiefly Expiatory, were <hi>Euchariſtical,</hi> and differing alſo from the manner in which the firſt was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by our Lord himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuch a Change in the nature of the Commemoration, from that of the Original Sacrifice, tho' not expreſs'd in the words of the Inſtitution, may yet be the better admitted, if we find cauſe to ſuppoſe it; becauſe our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Memorial of the Action, before it was <hi>done</hi> by himſelf, or ſo much as <hi>underſtood</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> may therefore be preſum'd, neither to have
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46380:151"/>held his Supper exactly and altogether in the ſame manner in which that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was afterwards to be, nor clearly to have expreſs'd its Nature; but to have left the more particular Directions for it, and Explanation of it, to the ſupervening Inſtructions of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Tho' therefore the Lord's Supper was erected out of a Paſchal Supper; yet the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as it has appear'd, did not underſtand it to be confin'd to that time of the year only, or to the uſe of Unleaven'd Bread; neither did they think their Duty diſcharg'd by an Annual Celebration of it. And ſo, in the judgment of their Diſciples, the Chriſtians of the next Generation, it is ſtill more manifeſt, that the one Supper ſucceeded the other, not in its ſtrict, but in its general nature, and as it was of the Euchariſtical kind; a ſolemn Feſtival kept in Thanks for a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and for a moſt beneficial and gracious Covenant: that as our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was not Temporary, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent Age only, and from an Enemy once ſlain, but was to extend to each Perſon of all Generations to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46380:151"/>come, and to be perpetually afforded againſt our continual ſpiritual Enemies; ſo neither ſhould its Recognition be reſtrain'd to one Seaſon, but offer'd unto our God throughout the whole Year, as the <hi>Sacrifices of Praiſe and Thanks</hi> were us'd to be offer'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> with very frequent and ſolemn Devotion.</p>
                     <p>This therefore ſeems to have been the Conſtruction of the Primitive Chriſtians, That the <hi>Sacrament of our Lord's Body and Blood</hi> anſwer'd to the Jewiſh <hi>Sacrifices of Thanks:</hi> and that this Correſpondence may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall do well to recollect a little the nature and manner of ſuch Oblations.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. THE nature of a <hi>Peace-Offering</hi> in general is well known. It was the Oblation of a Sacrifice, ſome certain parts of which were burnt on the Altar, others belong'd to the Prieſts, and the reſt was return'd to be eaten by the Offerer. To this Sacrifice a Meat-offering and Drink-offering were join'd: and by it the Offerer pray'd for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Proſperity, or thank'd for that he

                        </note>. In the more ſolemn kind of <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> that of <hi>Thanks,</hi> the Bread of the Meat-offering is expreſly requir'd and particulariz'd<note n="(b)" place="margin">Lev. 7.13. Maim. <hi>de Cult. Div.</hi> Tr. 5. cap. 9. §. 17, 18.</note>; and it conſiſted half of Unleaven'd and half of Leaven'd Bread; (tho' Leaven<note n="(c)" place="margin">Lev. 2.11. Maim. <hi>de Cult. Div.</hi> 4.5.1.</note> was not ſo grateful to the Altar, as ever to be offer'd for a Meat-offering upon it). The Unleaven'd half was made into thirty Cakes, each ten dreſs'd a ſeveral way, and the Leaven'd half into ten: The tenth of all, that is, four Cakes of the ſeveral ſorts, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Breaſt and Shoulder and Inwards, were wav'd by the <hi>Prieſt</hi> in the Hands of the Offerer before the Lord. Of that Bread ſo wav'd ſome was burnt on the Altar with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and the reſt, with the Breaſt and Shoulder, (all which together was call'd <hi>Muram</hi> the Separated or Elevated<note n="(c2)" place="margin">Maim. <hi>ut ſupra</hi> §. 12. <hi>Rab. Sal. in</hi> Exod. 29.27.</note> Portion) remain'd to be eat by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and his Domeſticks, who joyn'd his Thanks to God with the Offerers; while He likewiſe and his Family, and Friends, feaſted before God on the other Nine parts with the Fleſh of the Sacrifice remaining to him; Portions of which he ſent too
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46380:152"/>abroad, to his Acquaintance, and to the Poor.</p>
                     <p>Now, this Bread ſo offer'd being very ſingular for a Sacrifice, by reaſon part of it was Leaven'd, was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly call'd the <hi>Bread of Thankſgiving (d),</hi> and in one caſe, recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>(e),</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> is ſuppos'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> to have ſtood for the Living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to have ſupply'd its place. And beſides, it is there conceiv'd, that <hi>Leaven'd Bread</hi> alone was us'd, as being the principal part of the Euchariſtical Offering, and fitteſt to repreſent the whole.</p>
                     <p>Now the great <hi>Entertainments,</hi> as was now ſaid, of the <hi>Jews</hi> were made of their <hi>Peace-offerings:</hi> on thoſe they feaſted together with their Friends at home, and of thoſe they made Preſents to the abſent.

                     <p>Theſe Feaſts, after the building of the Temple, were neceſſarily held at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not elſewhere. But it may be rationally ſuppos'd, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it conjecturally (as I before have offer'd a like gueſs concerning the Paſſover<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 1.</note>), that the <hi>Jews</hi> of remote diſperſions, ſtanding the Temple, (for under its deſtruction they are not to rejoyce) did heretofore, upon glad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, tho' they would not pretend to the formality of an Euchariſtical Supper, yet make-ſome ſuch Feſtival Entertainments, to which they call'd their Friends, to rejoyce with them before God; giving him Thanks, not only for what they then eat and drank, but mentioning at the ſame time his other gracious Favours, which had been the cauſe of their preſent meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which they recognis'd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Benedictions and Hymns over the Bread and Wine. And Bread and Wine I therefore ſuppoſe to have been us'd in this Caſe, for the expreſſion of their Thanks, not only becauſe we find that the Leaven'd Euchariſtical Bread
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46380:153"/>did in the above-alledg'd caſe ſtand for the whole Sacrifice, or that ſome part of the Unleaven'd Paſchal Bread does now repreſent the Fleſh of the Lamb <hi>(k),</hi> or that in <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Feaſt the <hi>eating of Bread</hi> is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mention'd, or laſtly, that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> were given in the High Prieſt <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>'s entertainment of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which in probability was Euchariſtical for his Victory; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Creatures of God are ſtill taken by the <hi>Jews</hi> in all their Repaſts for a ſpecial occaſion of his Honour and Worſhip, as we might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before, and ſhall ſtraight ſee further.</p>
                     <p>Such Entertainments of which we have been ſpeaking, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were, we doubt not, very ſolemn, being dedicated to the honour of God: and tho' the particular Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are not told us, yet how thoſe Feaſts were kept we may well enough conjecture, from the deſcription we have already<note n="(l)" place="margin">The ſame §. as afore.</note> given of a <hi>Paſchal,</hi> compar'd with this that follows of an <hi>Ordinary Supper.</hi>

                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:46380:156"/>
                     <p>And laſtly, the <hi>Bread,</hi> which was to repreſent, and in ſome manner to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, <hi>the Body</hi> of our Lord, did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly ſucceed in the place of that <hi>Bread of Thanks</hi> which had been made uſe of before to ſtand for the <hi>Fleſh of an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical Sacrifice,</hi> and to make up the whole, even in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf; if it did not ſometimes, in places more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, according to the Conjecture now mention'd.</p>
                     <p>Now, as this Feaſt of our Lord <hi>was</hi> Euchariſtical, ſo we ſuppoſe it was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in a ſuitable <hi>manner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Bread and Wine chiefly deſign'd for the Holy Entertainment, being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided and brought on the Table, ſome part of the Bread (and ſo of the Wine) was, I ſuppoſe, taken up by the Preſident, or Chief of the company, (were he Apoſtle, Biſhop, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and bleſs'd in an extraordinary form, expreſſing the reaſon of the Thanks then offer'd, together with a Prayer, that the Holy Ghoſt would ſanctifie the Offering, (as Gifts brought to the Altar were eſteem'd to be;) and ſanctifie it particularly to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which it was prepar'd, that the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46380:156"/>Bread might effectually repreſent the Fleſh, or Body, for which it ſtood. This Bread and Wine, ſo offer'd and bleſs'd by the officiating Preſident, (as if it had been wav'd at the Altar) was the more Holy and Sacramental Part, of which they communicated, as of the Body and Blood of the Lord; while the reſt of the Oblation, which was leſs holy, as being conſecrated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vertue of the other, (like the remaining nine parts of the Bread of a Thanks-Offering) ſerv'd, together with other Proviſions, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the Supper at which they then fed.</p>
                     <p>And ſo, when afterwards the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Supper were divided, (about the time, I preſume, when the Legal Sacrifices were going to ceaſe) the Chriſtian Euchariſtical Oblation, as the Primitive Church ſpeaks, began then more diſtinctly to appear, and was made after Morning-Prayer, juſt as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Sacrifices with the <hi>Jews</hi> were offer'd after the Morning daily Sacrifice. And then, as under the Law, what of the Euchariſtical Sacrifice was offer'd at the Altar, the <hi>Muram,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46380:157"/>to the Prieſt: ſo that part which had been offer'd by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Priest,</hi> being more eſpecially ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and his Portion, was eaten in the Morning <hi>Sacramentally</hi> from his Hands; the Congregation being, as it were, his Family; while the other <hi>Reſidual Part</hi> was kept for the proviſion of the <hi>Love-Feaſt,</hi> to be held in the Evening, its accuſtom'd time.</p>
                     <p>Now as theſe ſolemn Suppers, call'd by the name of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> were in imitation of thoſe Sacrificial Feaſts held by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo were they of a like <hi>Name.</hi> For, if thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſtiled <hi>Love-Feaſts,</hi> as poſſibly they might be, yet they were plainly <hi>Peace-Feaſts,</hi> being made of Peace-Offerings of the moſt perfect kind, and being Symbols and Pledges of <hi>Peace,</hi> both in Heaven and Earth; the Offerer and his Gueſts partaking in ſome degree of the Table of God, and rejoycing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in mutual Good-will and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p>So did the Preſent partake of both parts of the Oblation in the Ancient Church, agreeably to the practice of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And when they ſent <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:46380:157"/>to the Abſent, they acted likewiſe according to their Cuſtom. We know that the Lay-Jews ſent of their part<note n="(b)" place="margin">Neh. 8.10.</note>; and I know not whether the <hi>Prieſts</hi> might not ſo do of their ſhare; neither is it much material. For, tho' the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Euchariſt was an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> yet it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it ſhould be bound to the niceneſs of all the <hi>Moſaick Rules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho' therefore a Sacrifice, by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, was not to be offer'd by night, as all legal Acts were to be done by the <hi>Jews</hi> in the day; and ſo the general practice of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> was to celebrate the Euchariſt in it: yet they might think themſelves at liberty to ſolemnize it before day, whenſoever any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reaſon ſhould require them ſo to do; for to their Lord the Day and Night were both alike.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe tho' the Euchariſtical Bread was no more to be kept till next day, than the Fleſh, by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, as being not to be niggardly ſav'd, but all of it ſpent that night in a cheerful liberality; and in this it was like their <hi>Manna:</hi> yet the Chriſtians might not think it unlawful in ſome
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46380:158"/>caſes to ſuffer ſome part of their Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to be left unto another day. For they had already invited all to their Feaſt who were capable of it; and they had not been ſparing in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, as far as was meet. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, even in this particular, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſomething of the Levitical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; burning ſtill, what ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at laſt unſpent. And thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if we underſtand their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſychius</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">

                     <p>Now to all this I have nothing to add, but only to take notice, that the <hi>mixture of Water</hi> with the Sacramental Wine, of which the Ancients ſpeak, was done too after the manner of the Jews; and, in their opinion, did not make it leſs proper for a Cup of Thankſgiving. For they likewiſe do not think<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                     <p n="5">§ V. IT ſufficiently appears, I preſume, that the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the ancient Chriſtians to be in the nature of an <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> (not of a <hi>Propitiatory</hi>) <hi>Sacrifice</hi> with the <hi>Jews.</hi> But further, That this kind of Sacrifice only ſhould remain, when all the reſt ſhould ceaſe; this alſo is conſonant to the Tradition of the Jews, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> tells us. For, upon this Saying of the Prophet<note n="(a)" place="margin">Jer. 33.11.</note>, That <hi>there ſhould be heard again in</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>the Voice of Joy, and the Voice of Gladneſs, the Voice of the Bridegroom, and the Voice of the Bride, the Voice of them that ſhall ſay, Praiſe the Lord of Hosts, for the Lord is good, and his Mercy endureth for ever, [and] of them that ſhall bring [the Sacrifice of] Praiſe [or Thanks] into the Houſe of the Lord:</hi> he comments on the laſt words in this manner; <hi>The Prophet ſays not that they
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46380:159"/>ſhall bring Sin-Offerings, or Treſpaſs-Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; becauſe in that day there would be no Wicked nor Sinners among them: for (as he before (b) told them) they ſhould all know the Lord.</hi>

                        <hi>And ſo have our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of bleſſed memory told us, That in the time to come all Sacrifices ſhould ceaſe, except the Sacrifice of Thankſgiving.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Saying of the Maſters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a great Truth, and better underſtood by Chriſtians, who <hi>know the Lord</hi> and themſelves ſo well, as to know, that the <hi>Sacrifices for Sin</hi> are not ceas'd by the ceaſing of Sin, but ſuperſeded by the Sacrifice made for them by their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>High-Prieſt;</hi> and that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Thankſgiving</hi> they are thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to make, is the Commemoration their Lord has inſtituted, for that their moſt gracious Redemption.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Opinion: and, as it appears from his manner of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was the general acknowledg'd Opinion of that Time.

This plain Teſtimony, of ſo Learn'd and Venerable a Perſon, at no longer a diſtance from the Apoſtles, ſeems unexceptionable: but for the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> it is abſolutely Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. For there he ſpeaks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, from his own perſonal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; having himſelf been acquainted with <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who was immediately <hi>ordain'd by the Apoſtles.</hi> And as ſure as this <hi>Polycarp</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> ſo plain it is there that <hi>Anicetus</hi> was of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time: and from their very Conference together, reported by this <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> (as we have ſeen<note n="(e)" place="margin">Part 1.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46380:162"/>Neither need I diſſemble, that thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> are ſtil'd <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the place laſt mention'd; ſince they are known to be <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the more eminent Degree, and to be the ſame ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with the ſame ſuperiour Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, the ſame diſtinction ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them and the inferiour <hi>Presbyters.</hi>

Theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (as all others, even the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi>) would be much better underſtood by us, if we diſtinctly knew the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumſtances of thoſe Churches; to which, no doubt, he ſpeaks very properly, tho' we now, out of the ſame words, can make but a general, and ſometimes a very ordinary ſence. But however ſomething of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe Times, and of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in thoſe Letters, appears thro' them. And as his Deſign ſeems to be to fortifie them againſt the Fears of the preſent Perſecution, and to warn them of the dangerous Hereſies ſprung from <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and then prevailing; ſo he manifeſts a particular care againſt Schiſm, and for the preſerving the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46380:163"/>Government of the Church. Before this time, the Diviſions of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> about their Governors, had occaſion'd a Letter from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Hand: and now in <hi>Aſia,</hi> when St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Apoſtle, was dead, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme controuling Authority was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; it is very likely that the Orders before eſtabliſh'd were in ſome danger of being ſubverted, by the Ambition and Unrulineſs of ſuch, whom the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by St. <hi>Paul</hi> had expreſly foretold to <hi>Timothy</hi> the Biſhop of their capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1.</note>. Now, that ſuch Attempts were then made upon the Authority of Church-Officers, and to the confuſion of their Diſtinction, may be gather'd from this <hi>Ignatius:</hi> as it alſo appears from his manner of Expreſſion, that ſuch a Diſtinction was no novel thing, and of modern erection; nor was it of ſlight concern.</p>
                     <p>In this view (as we may ſuppoſe) he tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> That <hi>they ought to glorifie Jeſus Christ, who had glorified them; to be of one mind, and to ſay the ſame thing; and to be ſubject to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and to the Presbytery, that they may be wholly ſanctified. You ought,</hi> ſays he,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46380:164"/>
                        <hi>to concur with your Biſhop; as you do; for your Presbytery is as conſonant to him, as ſtrings to an Instrument. And let no Man be deceiv'd: he that is not within the Altar, falls ſhort of the Bread of God: and he that does not come to the Aſſembly, is Proud; and it is written, God reſiſteth the Proud (d): Let us not then reſiſt the Biſhop, that we may be ſubject to God. And the more modeſt [and condeſcending] your Biſhop is, the more he is to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd: for he is to be look'd on, as the Lord himſelf.</hi> And laſtly he ſpeaks of <hi>their Concurrence with Chriſt; that they may obey the Biſhop, and the Presbytery, with an undiſtracted Mind; breaking [that] one Bread, which is the Medicine for Immortality, the Antidote againſt Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This, it ſeems, was neceſſary to be ſaid on this ſubject to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> amongſt whom, as amongſt the other <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches to whom he writes, the Peace of the Church, which St. <hi>John</hi>'s preſence had hitherto ſecur'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be diſturb'd. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his letter to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whoſe zeal in this caſe was ſo well known, he makes no mention of their obedience to ſpiritual Governours: in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46380:164"/>all his other letters to the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> he enlarges much on the ſame Topick; and was, it ſeems, oblig'd to preſs that Duty even upon the <hi>Smyrneans,</hi> where <hi>Polycarp</hi> himſelf was Biſhop. He does it after this manner. <hi>Fly Diviſions, as the beginning [or cauſe] of Evils. All of you, follow the Biſhop; as Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Father: and follow the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the Apoſtles; and reverence the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as the Commandment [or Mandato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (e)] of God. Let no one do any thing appertaining to the Church, without the Biſhop. Let that be eſteem'd a good Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which is under the Adminiſtration of the Biſhop, or ſuch as He ſhall appoint. Where the Biſhop appears, there let the People be: as where Jeſus Chriſt is, there is the Catholick Church. It is not lawful without the Biſhop, neither to Baptize, nor keep the Love-Feaſt; but what He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, that is it which is acceptable to God.</hi> So to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> after Exhortation to Unity under the Biſhop, he adds: <hi>Take care therefore to uſe one</hi> Euchariſt. <hi>For there is one Fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Christ, one Cup wherein his Blood is united, one Altar: as there is one Biſhop, with the Presbytery, and my Fellow Servants the Deacons.</hi> As alſo in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46380:165"/>that to the <hi>Magneſians</hi> he directs: <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do all things in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimity of God; the Biſhop Preſiding in the place of God, and the Presbyters in the place of the Conſiſtory</hi> [Synedrium] <hi>of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and the Deacons being intruſted with the Miniſtry of Jeſus Christ.</hi> And ſpeaking of <hi>Deacons</hi> to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> he ſays expreſly, <hi>they are not Miniſters of Meats and Drinks; but Servants of the Church of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know well that theſe now Unuſual expreſſions, and High Compariſons, have been conſtrued into a prejudice againſt the Authority of theſe Letters. But it is not reaſonable, to judge either Antient Practice, or Phraſe, by the Modern: for poſſibly thoſe Primitive Chriſtians would be at as great a loſs to underſtand ſome later Divinity. The Paſſage that may appear the moſt ſtrange, is that to the <hi>Smyrneans: Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Biſhop, as Chriſt Jeſus [followed] the Father.</hi> But we are to remember that the Hereticks, whom he warns them to avoid, were thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the <hi>reality of our Saviour's Fleſh,</hi> ſaying, that He <hi>Suffer'd,</hi> and <hi>Roſe</hi> again in <hi>Appearance</hi> only; themſelves alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing with the <hi>Reality of their Duty,</hi>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:46380:165"/>as he tells them, and being <hi>Chriſtians</hi> only <hi>in Appearance, High-minded and puffed up.</hi> Theſe he Commands them to avoid: and, for the ſame intent, he cautions them to <hi>ſhun Diviſions</hi> among themſelves, as <hi>the beginning of</hi> thoſe and moſt other <hi>evils;</hi> and <hi>to Follow the Biſhop (Polycarp,</hi> a Faithful Servant of Chriſt, Approv'd and intruſted with the Charge of them by the Bleſſed St. <hi>John</hi>); adding, <hi>as Chriſt Jeſus, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> a compariſon that no more equals the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> than it does the other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of that Church to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It imported only, that they ſhould not be high-minded and conceited, but ſhould be ſubject to their Biſhop; for <hi>Christ</hi> alſo himſelf was in <hi>reality</hi> found in <hi>the form of a Servant,</hi> and <hi>obedient unto the Father even unto the Death of the Croſs:</hi> and that they ſhould receive the Commandments from <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp;</hi> and act, as they ſaw him to act; for (as St. <hi>John</hi> lately departed from them had inform'd them) Chriſt alſo did or ſpoke<note n="(d)" place="margin">8.28.12.49.</note> nothing from himſelf, and he both Taught and kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Father<note n="(e)" place="margin">15.10.</note>.

                     <p>Next I am come to compare the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> ſo diſtinguiſh'd as above, with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers of the Jewiſh. But in this, as for the Synagogue-Diſcipline, and Worſhip, of the Jews, I am prevented by what has been ſaid before: and the Parallel muſt have manifeſtly appear'd betwixt the <hi>Biſhop, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Deacon;</hi> and between the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or <hi>Synagogue,</hi> the <hi>Elders,</hi> and their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Officers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For as every <hi>City</hi> had its <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> in that manner Officer'd, with the Jews, ſo had it with the Chriſtians; though with no Subordination to any other higher Court, as at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> in as much as that Local Dependance was now aboliſh'd.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chief</hi> of the Conſiſtory with the Jews, was either the <hi>Prince;</hi> or his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of the Aſſembly. Now the Title of <hi>Prince</hi> was, I ſuppoſe, in the Chriſtian Church, every where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:46380:168"/>was as the <hi>Father,</hi> in whom the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Directive Power was lodged. The other <hi>Elders</hi> were his Councellors and Aſſiſtants, in the Governing and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Aſſembly; and the <hi>Deacons</hi> had the management of Affairs, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Orders, and Diſtribution of Alms, belonging to their part; as is notoriouſly known.</p>
                     <p>Thus was a Chriſtian Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd conformably to the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as a <hi>Society;</hi> it was likewiſe, as a <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> The <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> belong'd to the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> or elſe, by his leave, to the <hi>Presbyters:</hi> or it was perform'd by ſuch other proper Perſon, as the Biſhop ſhould appoint. Likewiſe <hi>Prayers</hi> were ſaid, either by the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Presbyters;</hi> or elſe by the <hi>Deacons.</hi> For theſe laſt, anſwering the Jewiſh <hi>Chazans,</hi> directed the People in their Devotions; either repeating the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before them, or calling upon them to hearken to thoſe repeated by others: and alſo either Read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or aſſiſted thoſe who were to Read them.</p>
                     <p>Neither do the <hi>Elders</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church agree, only ſo far,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46380:169"/>but farther yet. For as the <hi>Jewiſh El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> ſince the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> have thought fit to aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much of the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Honour and Privilege: ſo have the <hi>Christian</hi> ſucceeded into the like Dignity, nay are call'd by the ſame Name; as we have ſeen in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s expreſſion,<note n="(h)" place="margin">See Ch. 6. §. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>The High Priest who is the Biſhop;</hi> and as he phraſes it, diſcourſing about thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, who making little diſtinction between the People and the Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, committed <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Offices to the <hi>Laiety (i);</hi> and as we may in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have collected, even from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive Appellatives themſelves of <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> and <hi>Clergy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church derive not thoſe their ſtyle and Privileges from the Calamities of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and the Uſurpation of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins:</hi> nor are they eſteem'd <hi>Prieſts,</hi> in vertue of their <hi>Presbytery;</hi> though the Engliſh word <hi>Priest</hi> happens to come, by the French <hi>Preſtre,</hi> from the Latin <hi>Presbyter.</hi> On the contrary, by Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appointment, a <hi>Christian Prieſt</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds as directly to a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a <hi>Presbyter</hi> does to their <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:46380:169"/>or rather, to ſpeak more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> anſwer not more to the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue;</hi> than they do to thoſe of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> or (as we conceive) his <hi>Great Vicar,</hi> to the <hi>Priests,</hi> and to the <hi>Levites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this is not only intimated by the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Titles the Governours of the Church immemorially had, as we learn'd from <hi>Tertullian;</hi> but plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd by their Office, and all along al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd and own'd by more Antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: They having, as hath appear'd, an <hi>Eucharistical Sacrifice</hi> ſtill remaining to be celebrated by them; a Pure <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> to be offer'd in every place; and every where <hi>Holy Tables,</hi> or <hi>Altars,</hi> erected for that Service.

                     <p>This Remembrance of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was, we ſee, well founded: and is, if I miſtake not, atteſted by the ſtructure of an Antient Chriſtian Church, ſuch of which we have been ſpeaking before<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ch. 6. §. 1, 3.</note>.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46380:171"/>Hall, gave occaſion to the ſeveral Ranks and Offices of Chriſtians; ſo neither to the Building, which was to be ſuited to them. I ſhould rather ſuppoſe, that the Congruity of thoſe two ſorts of Aedifices was accidental, and that the name came from the ſimilitude. <hi>(t)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are indeed others who take the Modules of our Churches from the Jews; but either from their <hi>Synagogues;</hi> or from the Temple-<hi>Houſe,</hi> conſiſting of the [H Fig. 1.] Porch, the Holy [I], and the Holy of Holies [K]. Whereas the <hi>Synagogue</hi> goes but half way, and neither now has, nor ever pretended to, an <hi>Altar:</hi> and the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>Table of Shewbread,</hi> which were in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> were we know in the Outer Part, and not in the inmoſt, the Holy of Holies.</p>
                     <p>It appears therefore, that the <hi>Temple,</hi> as it conſiſted of its <hi>ſeveral Courts,</hi> was rather the Pattern which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> follow'd for the Place of their Worſhip.

                     </p>
                     <p>But (to return to my Argument) whatever may become of the Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture concerning the Figure of our Churches, this is certain, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration of the Scripture<note n="(x)" place="margin">See Repart. 2.

                     <p>This Diſcipline then is well known to have been Executed in the Primitive Church, by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> with great ſeverity; and to have been

Being to juſtify the Chriſtian Aſſemblies from the Imputation, put upon them, by the Imperial Officers, and common Opinion, of their being Unlawful Aſſociations, and dangerous Conventicles, He ſays: <hi>We are indeed a Corporation, embodied by our Agreement in the ſame Religion, and Obedience to the ſame Diſcipline; and are Confederate, by the ſame Hope. We Meet together; but it is before God. Him we ſurround with our Prayers, and as it were with our Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Force; but this is ſuch a violence, as is acceptable unto Him. And then our Prayers are, for our Emperours, for their Officers, and ſuch as are put in Authority. We meet; but it is to refreſh our memory by Reading the Word of God—There too (c) is the place for Exhortation, and for Reproof; and there our Manners are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and Cenſur'd, as it were by God himſelf. For Cauſes are there judg'd with great deliberation; as it is fit to be done by thoſe who know, that they Judge in the Preſence and ſight of God: and if any one ſhall be found ſo Criminal, as to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46380:175"/>from the Communion of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Aſſemblies, and from the reſt of our Holy Commerce; this Judgment ſo paſs'd upon him, is taken for the Higheſt Preſumption, that can be, of a like Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come.

                     <p>And, agreeably to this, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen, that Excommunication with the Jews was Lighter, or Heavier, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46380:178"/>differently Aggravated, as the Cauſe deſerv'd<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ch. 5. §. 1.</note>. It has likewiſe appear'd probable, that the ſeveral Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates may have lain under ſeveral Prohibitions, as to their Approach in the Synagogues or Temple<note n="(g)" place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>. And ſince it has been ſhown, that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Proſelytes enter'd into their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the ſame Degrees, by which the Chriſtians did<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ch. 6.</note>: we cannot doubt, but thoſe of them who had been ſolemnly excluded the Temple, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Re-enter'd it after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, advancing ſucceſſively thorough the ſeveral Courts, (as thoſe did who had been under corporal Pollution,) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Purification.</p>
                     <p>We have yet ſpoken only of the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> effect of Excommunication, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions the Excluſion from all <hi>Sacred Commerce</hi> only: and this, no doubt, is the proper juriſdiction of that Presbyterial Authority, which pretends not to govern the Commerce or Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations of this World. But there can be no queſtion, but that the Faithful always avoided any great Familiarity, or intimate Converſation, with the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46380:178"/>Excommunicates; other than to Reform and Reconvert them. And this the Scripture it ſelf ſeems to direct<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note>: and neceſſary it was, to the Humiliation and Mortification of the Criminal, and for the danger of others being corrupted by him: though the other common Entercourſe, the Chriſtians were to have with their Neighbours of all ſorts, was to be regulated by the Policy of that Temporal Government, to which they belong'd. But, when the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> became <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as it thought fit to enlarge the proper Presbyterial Power with ſome new Juriſdiction, in things confining upon that Office; as in <hi>Cauſes Teſtamentary</hi> and <hi>Matrimonial:</hi> ſo it back'd their Excommunication, with civil Reſtraints and Penalties. And thence thoſe who were under the Greater Excommunication, have been forbid all common Converſation, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd uncapable of ſeveral Legal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and ſometimes Impriſon'd, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe puniſh'd in Body or Eſtate: in all which proceedings the Patterns of the Jews, as is evident, has been much follow'd; as it ſeems to be, in the <hi>Three Admonitions</hi> before the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46380:180"/>his Pilgrimage to lay himſelf at the door of the Synagogue, that they who go in and out may paſs over him; (but they are not to tread upon him).</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Adulterer</hi> is to undergo Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as bitter as Death; (for he is, by the Law, Guilty of Death): for a Year not to eat Fleſh, nor drink Wine, except, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every day, in the Winter, to ſit in Snow or Ice for an hour, and in the Summer amidſt Bees or Waſps; or (as it is in the other Penitential<note n="(k)" place="margin">Page 157.</note>) every day, that he ſuffers not from the Cold or Heat, to Faſt, and to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Bread and Water in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: every day to confeſs his Sins with Tears and Sighs; and to be beat with the 39 ſtripes; and to ly upon the Ground, or a Plank without ſtraw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except on Holy-Days; to wear Sack-cloath alſo, and to lead a mournful Life, and to keep from all Converſation with Women.

                     <p>Theſe are the moſt Criminal Caſes: and I ſhall only obſerve, of the other there mention'd, what we ſaw in one inſtance above, that <hi>Forty Days</hi> are commonly ſpecified for a more ſolemn Penitence, and injoin'd in almoſt all of them; as alſo in general, that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent is ſuppos'd to be as a Mourner.</p>
                     <p>Now no one that reads theſe Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Injunctions, and knows any thing of the Practice of the Antient Church, but will eaſily diſcern the Correſpondence. He will preſently call to mind the ſeverity of old, that was us'd eſpecially to Adulterers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and Relaps'd Idolaters; the Difficulty they found to be Reſtor'd, and the Long and Rigorous Penances they underwent: How they Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Mourn'd, and Proſtrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46380:181"/>before the Doors of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, at the feet of the Brethren; ſome of them not re-admitted till after many years; others not Reconcil'd till the Point of Death; and ſome not at all, though left to the Mercy of God; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their time in Faſting, and other Hardſhips, for the Humiliation of their Body and Spirit, and a teſtification of their ſorrow both before God and Men. So like in very many points, was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Penitents, both in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and in the Church: not to mention Change, of Name, or courſe of Life; Pilgrimaging, Voluntary Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or Abjuration, eſpecially of Murderers; The tying up of their Arms in an Iron Chain; and ſuch kind of Practices, which were frequent in after Ages, and might have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times us'd before, though not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                     <p>But, for a general view of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of Practice in the Primitive Church, we need only to compare <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s Tract of <hi>Penitence;</hi> or but only to look back upon thoſe two Paſſages, already cited thence in the ſecond Chapter of the Firſt Part. And, as for
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46380:182"/>the Vertue aſſigned to all kind of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, we may find a ſuitable Opinion of them in <hi>Hermas</hi> the Antient Chriſtian Writer. He is told by the Angel, that <hi>he is Afflicted, to the end his Family may ſuffer and Repent:</hi> and when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that <hi>behold they already Repent from the bottom of their Hearts;</hi> the Angel replies, <hi>I know they do. But do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou think (m) that the Sins of thoſe who Repent, are preſently blotted out? No not ſo quickly. But he that is a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, muſt Afflict his Soul; and behave himſelf Humbly, in all he has to do; and endure many, and grievous Vexations; and when he has ſuffer'd much, then God may have mercy on him.</hi>

                     <p n="7">§. VII. NOW to this laſt deſcrib'd <hi>Jewiſh Order</hi> of Morning Prayers, ſo far did the Antient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> agree, as to begin likewiſe with <hi>Lections and Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody:</hi> and from the Jewiſh Cuſtom of <hi>ſitting</hi> at the Repeating of thoſe Pſalms it is, that ſuch <hi>Portions of the Pſaltery</hi> as are now read by the Greeks, without any interpoſition, are call'd by them <hi>ſittings (a):</hi> as alſo the <hi>Laudatory Hymns</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, us'd at Morning Prayer, which is thence call'd the <hi>Lauds</hi> by the <hi>Latin,</hi> ſeem to have been plac'd there after the ſame Example. As to the <hi>Lections,</hi> the Chriſtians have the variety of the Jews: for as theſe read in the Morning out of their <hi>Miſna,</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Law;</hi> ſo had we our Leſſons alſo out of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural</hi> Authors, and the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells.</hi> And herein the <hi>Goſpel</hi> with us, anſwered plainly to their <hi>Law.</hi> For though we read the Goſpel before the ſolemn Prayers, and they the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46380:195"/>(and in this order only we differ,) yet the <hi>Lection</hi> was made with us in the like Solemnity; the People <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,</hi> and before and after <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and Praiſing <hi>God;</hi> as the <hi>Book</hi> is alſo in the Greek Church, even at Morning Prayer, carried about with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and <hi>Kiſs'd</hi> by the People. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Lection</hi> and <hi>Pſalmody</hi> (or Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody and Lection, for they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomewhat intermixt,) with the <hi>Exhortation,</hi> if any was made; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Hearers</hi> and <hi>Catechumens</hi> were diſmiſs'd by the Chriſtians; (and at the ſame time, I ſuppoſe, they were diſmiſs'd by the Jews, when they had any;) our <hi>Creed,</hi> and their <hi>Shema,</hi> come together: and then, in either Church, the <hi>Prayers</hi> properly ſo call'd. And laſtly theſe, on certain days of the Week, are clos'd with the Litany, by both.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ordinary <hi>Morning Services</hi> anſwer one another: and ſo alſo does our <hi>Communion Service,</hi> ſtrictly taken, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their <hi>Additional;</hi> coming at the end of all, in a diſtinct Office. For in a <hi>Greek Liturgy</hi> (for Example) both the Pſalmody, and Lections, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46380:195"/>Creed, and the firſt Prayers, are known to be nothing elſe but an abbreviated repetition of the Morning Office; (as the Jews too ſhorten theirs on their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals:) and then after that, (as with us of <hi>England</hi> after the Prayer for Chriſt's Church) the Office of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> begins, the Celebration of the <hi>Additional</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">§. VIII. THUS much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Agreement, in the Method and <hi>Order</hi> of Prayers: other particular cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondences may be obſerved, of which I ſhall note but a few, leaving ſuch as are more obvious to the Readers own reflections. And <hi>firſt</hi> it may be remark'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> Liturgy, that when any new Action is enter'd upon in any part of the Service; it is begun with a <hi>Benediction of God (a):</hi> in like manner as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe to do. And <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> in the preparation to the more ſolemn Prayers, at the putting on of the <hi>Habits</hi> in which the Prieſt is to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate, appropriate <hi>Benedictions</hi> are ſaid; and one of them, as at the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of the <hi>Girdle,</hi> much the ſame with that the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe <hi>(b). Thirdly,</hi>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:46380:196"/>As <hi>our</hi> Collects conclude generally with the Laud and Honour of God, ſo do <hi>Theirs. Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Triumphal Hymn,</hi> as it is call'd in the Greek Church <hi>(c), Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God, &amp;c.;</hi> is always ſolemnly ſaid by their <hi>Chazan,</hi> with the third Collect of their Daily Prayers. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And whereas, when thoſe words are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, the <hi>Jews,</hi> with an Exulting Geſture, are us'd to <hi>Lift up, not their Eyes only, but their whole Bodies; and to Leap up thrice</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">B. Syn. Jud. <hi>10.</hi>
                        </note> at that Trine Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, for ſo they call it, of God; the ſame Cuſtom appears to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd among the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at a like Prayer: at the latter end of which they are all reported <hi>(e)</hi> to have <hi>join'd in with their Voices, lifting up their Heads and Hands to Heaven, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſing their Feet; as if they would have follow'd their Prayers towards the Spiritual Eſſence, and aſcended up in Body as well as in Mind. Sixthly,</hi> Further, that antient form of our Thankſgiving (which follows theſe words in the Communion Service, <hi>Let us give thanks to our Lord God</hi>) with its ſpecial Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſometimes aſſign'd; ſeems to be
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46380:196"/>conceiv'd after the Pattern of the Jews Euchariſtical Collect, the Firſt of the laſt three. <hi>Seventhly</hi> and laſtly, Their <hi>Kadiſh,</hi> or larger <hi>Hymn</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> may anſwer to our <hi>Angelic one,</hi> at the end of our Engliſh Communion; <hi>Glory to be to God on High, on Earth, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many ſuch Correſpondencies may be found between the ſolemn Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Synagogue, and of the Church of Chriſt: and had we any ſufficient account of the Prayers, that were daily ſaid in the Temple, by the Prieſts and Levites; (as we have now notice of little more than what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the Synagogue, by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and one of them their Deputy;) I queſtion not, but that our Antient Liturgies would be found to come much nearer to their Rites. IT is known, that the <hi>Orarium</hi>

                        </note> and it may be obſerv'd that, as a Prieſt in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church begins many Actions from the Admonition of the Deacon <hi>(b);</hi> ſo did the Prieſts heretofore from the like Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                        </note>: and when they tell us, that it was ten times pronounc'd by the High Prieſt on the Day of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they let us alſo know<note n="(l)" place="margin">Maim. De Cult. Div. <hi>8.2.7.</hi>
                        </note>, that the Prieſts and People in their ſeveral Courts, every time they heard it ſpoke out, <hi>fell down</hi> upon their knees with their Faces to the ground, and <hi>cry'd out, Bleſſed be the Name of the Glory of his Kingdom for Ever and Ever.</hi> And from that Cuſtom the <hi>Reverence</hi> us'd to the <hi>name of Jeſus</hi> may have come: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Appropriate name</hi> of our Bleſſed <hi>Lord; a Name,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays<note n="(m)" place="margin">Phil. 2.9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>above every Name,</hi> even above the name <hi>Jehova</hi> ſo much glorified under the Old Covenant, and by which the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> would be hereafter Honour'd. So the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might <hi>bow</hi> at the mention of that Name, in imitation of the like practice of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and to that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Apoſtle may be well thought to allude, when he ſays, that <hi>at the Name of Jeſus every knee,</hi> of every Place, henceforth <hi>ſhould bow; every Tongue</hi> alſo <hi>Confeſſing,</hi> (for in the Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46380:197"/>of the Temple the Tongue alſo had its part;) <hi>that Jeſus is the Lord,</hi> and King; and all this ſtill <hi>to the Glory of God the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus have I at laſt concluded this incidental Diſcourſe, concerning the Derivation of Chriſtian Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Jews; much indeed too prolix, in regard to my firſt deſign; though poſſibly not too long, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the importance of the ſubject it ſelf; and which might eaſily have been enlarg'd yet further. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Anſwer to one Objection has increas'd ſo enormouſly, yet the other Two may have a quicker Diſpatch, and ſhall take up only one Chapter more.</p>

                     <p>Neither is it to be deny'd, but that the <hi>Jews</hi> have deſerv'd this Diſgrace: having brought their Traditions under a ſuſpicion, by the fooliſh way they took to advance the Credit of them.

                     <p>We ſhall not therefore wonder, if
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46380:200"/>ſuch confident Pretences, as theſe, have provok'd the World to inquire, and examine; and, as is uſual, extreamly to Under value and Depreſs, what others have more unreaſonably enhanc'd. And thus both that Fam'd Book, and its Commentaries, are bid to go down three or four hundred years lower, than they were plac'd by their too Devoted Admirers<note n="(c)" place="margin">Morin. Exerc. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò dictá.</note>: the Text it ſelf, is eſteem'd an uncertain Rhapſody; and the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory Additions to it, a Heap of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies and Idle Tales.

                     <p>Now as to my own part, my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with theſe Jews has not been ſo great, as that I ſhould think my ſelf bound to engage in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and to juſtify the pretended Age and Authority of their Writings. That their Accounts were more Full in many material Caſes, I have often had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to wiſh: and that they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46380:200"/>true, I muſt confeſs I am never intirely ſatisfied, until I find them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Concurrence of ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teſtimony; ſuch a prejudice has that pretence of <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> given me. I ſhall not therefore undertake to offer more in their favour, than theſe two Conſiderations: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that ſuch <hi>Traditional Memoirs</hi> are <hi>no Novel things;</hi> but that ſuch <hi>Miſnaioths</hi> were certainly very old, more early and better Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, even than the Rabbins give out: and <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it is <hi>not</hi> likely, that their Accounts of their Cuſtoms were <hi>ſuggeſted by our Writers,</hi> or form'd from the Obſervation of Chriſtian Practice.</p>

And if it had then that Authority with the Jews, it muſt be ſuppos'd, to have riſen up to it after
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46380:201"/>ſome conſiderable Tract of Time, and not to have been compil'd in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man; unleſs we too will fall into the Rabbinical Fable, and make it to have been held ſo highly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred at its firſt appearance.

                     <p>From this Teſtimony of St. <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> it ſeems to be plain againſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of St. <hi>Auguſt in,</hi> and the Modern Opinion of the Jews, that there was ſome kind of written <hi>Miſnah,</hi> in the firſt Age of Chriſtianity: as it is very
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46380:202"/>probable alſo, that this preſent <hi>Miſnah</hi> of Rabbi <hi>Jehudah</hi>'s might be extant at the latter end of the Fourth Age, the time of that now mention'd Father, and of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though theſe two laſt Authors do not mention this very Book; yet, as they both underſtood the Jewiſh Learning well, ſo they let us underſtand that this Traditional Part of it was then in high Eſteem with them, cited for Unqueſtionable Authority, and reputed of very great Antiquity. St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> ſpeaking of Jewiſh Traditions in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, ſays <hi>(e)</hi> that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch they continued to have in his, (He for his part ſuppoſing them to be the ſame,) under the name of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary (f)</hi> Ordinances: and adds, that if they were ask'd, for Example, how they came to take the Liberty of a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Journey,</hi> when their <hi>Law</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to <hi>ſit in their Houſe;</hi> they were ready to juſtify themſelves by that other, their <hi>Traditional,</hi> Authority, and to anſwer that <hi>Rab Akiba, and Simeon and Hillel</hi> (Names famous in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>(g)</hi> Collection) <hi>had allow'd them to walk Two Thouſand Feet on that Day</hi> (two

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46380:203"/>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Traditions of the Elders:</hi> he tells him, that for what relates to the <hi>Elders,</hi> he is not able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify it by the <hi>Scripture (for the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Elders are no where extant in the Law);</hi> and that this his ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit proceeds from his Ignorance in thoſe matters. For, ſays he, <hi>the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Elders, are by the Jews call'd Secondary Inſtructions; and they are four: the Firſt, bears the Name of</hi> Moſes; (as ſome of their Traditions do now); <hi>the Second is of</hi> Rabbi Akiba, <hi>as they call him; the third, of</hi> Adda, <hi>or</hi> Juda; <hi>and the fourth, of the Sons of</hi> Aſamoneus. <hi>But where in the five Books of the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch is that of the</hi> Corban, <hi>mention'd by our Saviour, to be found? you cannot ſhew it. Your Aſſertion therefore falls to the ground: that ſaying of the</hi> Corban, <hi>no where appearing in the Pentateuch.</hi> Now hence we ſee <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Traditions, which the Jews had in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his time, were the ſame, in his Judgment, which were in our Saviour's time: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that thoſe Traditions in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were not then kept unwritten: for otherwiſe our. Author would have taken another courſe with <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46380:203"/>and have told him, that thoſe Traditions were ſo far from being writ down in the Pentateuch, that they were not yet written at all. And <hi>thirdly</hi> we may conjecture from his manner of Expreſſion, that the Jews had four <hi>Miſnah</hi>'s diſtinct then; and that the Compilation, or Digeſt, of them, and of ſome later added, is the <hi>Miſnaioth</hi> we now have.</p>
                     <p>Such an Account do theſe Fathers give us of the reputed Authority of the Jewiſh Traditions, about the year of our Lord 400. But further, that ſome of them were not unwritten in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Age, we have before ſeen from <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Epiſtle: and that they were in great vogue in our Saviour's time, is apparent from the Goſpels; as alſo from <hi>Joſephus (m),</hi> that there were ſuch <hi>Cuſtoms which had obtain'd a long while in</hi> Johannes Hyrcanus <hi>his Days,</hi> above a 100. Years before our Saviour, <hi>and which they of that time had receiv'd from their Fathers, not written in the Laws of</hi> Moſes; (for neither does he ſay, that they were no where writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten).</p>
                     <p>It is manifeſt therefore, from what
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46380:204"/>has been premiſed; That ſuch like Traditions, as the Jews now give us, pretended even in our Saviour's time to great Antiquity, and were then much Celebrated and Regarded, and ſome of them in that Age reduc'd into Writing; That thoſe Traditions, whatever they were, were ſuppos'd by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to have been carefully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Jews, down to their days; and that therefore the Author of the preſent <hi>Miſna,</hi> if he were indeed as late as thoſe two Chriſtian Doctors, muſt however be allow'd to have had the opportunity of thoſe Memorials, for the Baſis of his Collection; and muſt be alſo judg'd to have us'd that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, if only by the credit his Work obtain'd with thoſe of his own Nation. So that if we do not receive the Jewiſh Traditions, with the ſame implicite Faith the Jews do; yet neither ſhould we peremptorily reject them, as Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and Groundleſs, and of Modern Invention; but rather give them ſuch a fair equitable Entertainment, as to think, that though ſomething of them may be falſe, yet much alſo may be true; being ready to admit them to be
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46380:204"/>true, upon the concurrence of any New unſuſpected Teſtimony, the only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that I have to deſire in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>

Thence it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> have been brought to contribute very much to the Explication of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> neither could they have been denied this Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, but becauſe it was thought, to be too great an honour for them, by ſuch, who ſeem reſolv'd to be as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt them, as they are againſt the Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. IV. From no better a reaſon, when ſuch a conſent between the New Teſtament and the Jewiſh Traditions appears, is that other ſurmiſe thrown in; that this Agreement is by fraud,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46380:205"/>and that the Later Rabbins tranſcrib'd their Cuſtoms out of our ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: a ſurmiſe abſolutely as ground-leſs, as any Jewiſh Tradition can be; and no leſs Improbable.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, when we certainly know, that the Jews of old had ſuch Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Memoirs of their own current amongſt them; it cannot but ſeem much more reaſonable and natural, to ſuppoſe their Preſent Traditions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd thence, than from our Teſtament: eſpecially ſince we find, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit it ſelf is Novel, and that the Elder Chriſtians <hi>Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who knew the Jews and their Learning beſt, never enter'd into it, but preſum'd the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it at all <hi>likely,</hi> that the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> ever increas'd the knowledge of their Cuſtoms by the help of our Writings: not only becauſe that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has all along affected to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to our Learning, partly out of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and partly out of Contempt: but becauſe it actually appears, by their Groſs miſtakes in many points of Hiſtory, (miſtakes with which they are much reproach'd by thoſe<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mor. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But we need not go ſo far about, to refute this ſuſpicion of Jewiſh Forgery: it being evident only from the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e view of ſuch Traditional Particulars, and of the Texts of the Goſpel, to which they relate. For whereas many Circumſtances of thoſe Traditions give ſo natural, and appoſite, and full, a ſence to their ſeveral Texts, that they juſtify at the ſame time their own Truth: they are alſo, we ſee, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely expreſs'd, and covertly hinted in thoſe Texts; that they themſelves could never have been ſuggeſted, and rais'd thence. This evidently appears, to give no other Examples, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels of Baptiſm, or of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ch. 2, &amp; 3. of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</note>: in either of which, the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Cuſtoms afford a clear Explanation to many a Paſſage of our Scripture; but receive none. And that they could not be rais'd, and explain'd thence; is
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46380:206"/>very plain in fact. For theſe Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which as ſoon as we have learn'd them from the Jews, every one in theſe latter Ages, eaſily and immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Expoſition of the Holy Text; were never in the leaſt thought of by thoſe many Antient Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ours, who wanted indeed the help of the Jewiſh Learning, but wanted not the Application nor Diſcernment, which the beſt Jewiſh Maſter could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to bring.</p>
                     <p n="5">§. V. The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt <hi>Prejudice,</hi> we fear'd might be rais'd againſt a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Derivation of Lent, was from its <hi>Novelty;</hi> that it cannot be true, becauſe not mention'd by any Authors before.</p>
                     <p>But this is an Objection, which may have been already remov'd, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Probability of ſome like Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which we have now offer'd at, if the Reader has been ſo favourable as to admit them. However, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I preſume, reject thoſe very many Explications of the Text of the New Teſtament, which Modern Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators have given us from the Accounts of Jewiſh Cuſtoms; ſo he will reflect,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46380:207"/>that moſt of them were lately very New, and ſuch as are not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd by the Antient Expoſitors.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it to be wonder'd at, that the Antients left many ſuch Derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Alluſions unmention'd; or any Imputation upon them, if they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have been more ignorant of the Jewiſh Cuſtoms, than we now are.</p>
                     <p>It is well known, that in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there was very frequent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication betwixt the Jews, and the Chriſtians; and that moſt of the firſt Converts to our Church came from the Synagogue. Yet in a little time there grew, we know, not only a ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between thoſe of the two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but, on the Jews part, a great and a fierce Hatred: then when the Proſelytes from the Gentiles had fill'd our Churches, and moſt of the Biſhops and Doctors began to be of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Of that rank were the greateſt Men, remember'd to us, of the ſecond Century: and among them are thoſe eminent Writers, ſtill preſerv'd, <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> Men admirably skill'd
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46380:207"/>in the Heathen Learning, but in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh no further, than the Scriptures had inform'd them, and that too by a Greek Tranſlation. And although, amongſt thoſe who followed them in the next Ages, ſome one or two, as <hi>Origen</hi> in the third, and <hi>Jerom</hi> in the fourth, were better ſeen in that Knowledge: yet they choſe to uſe it, rather to compare and rectify the Tranſlations, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, of the Old Teſtament, by the help of the Language; than to bring any Traditional Rites, or Phraſe, thence, for a Correſpondence with the Doctrines, and Uſages, of the New. Whether it was then thought, in the heighth of that Animoſity, that ſuch a compariſon would do the Jews too much honour: or whether it happen'd by the Allegorical humour, which <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> affected, and the other imitated; they endeavouring ſo much to ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the plain Facts and Ordinances of the Hebrew Text, that much litteral account of Unſcriptural Ordinances could not be expected from them.</p>
                     <p>From what therefore concerns the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; there being but little uſe made
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46380:208"/>of the Jewiſh Learning, by thoſe few that chanc'd to know it; the other Commentators as (for example) S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin, Chryſostom,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> beſtow'd their pains in the uſe of what helps they had: and they gather'd thence a Plain, and True, and Uſeful, ſence of the Text; though, in ſome places, not ſo Elegant, and Full, as that the words would have expreſs'd. Neither is it any diſreputation to their Comments, that they reach'd not the Heighth of the Original; no more than it is, to the beſt Tranſlations. Neither were they under a much greater Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in not underſtanding here and there a Criticiſm, underſtood now by us; than we now are, if any thing of that kind, unobſerv'd by us, ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be remark'd by thoſe that come after. In all Ages of Chriſtianity, there has ſtill been more of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures underſtood, than was neceſſary for their great deſign, the Salvation of Believers: and poſſibly the Providence of God has ſo order'd the Diſpenſations of Knowledge, that there might be ſome equality between us, and thoſe nearer the Apoſtles; and that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46380:208"/>of thoſe many advantages we have loſt, this new Information ſhould be given.</p>
                     <p>And in particular as for <hi>Rites</hi> and Uſages, this may be remember'd; that as we have, in the few Writings of the firſt Ages that remain, but an occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accidental mention of ſuch Uſages; (for ſuch things were then too well known, to be ſtudiouſly and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially deſcrib'd;) ſo we have leſs notice of their Original, to expect. For that likewiſe was in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, too obvious to be diſcours'd of; and after, when it came to be leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, was not much inquir'd into: thoſe primitive Chriſtians wanting no originary Derivations, to reconcile them to ſuch Cuſtoms, as they knew pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Apoſtolical Men; and not being ſo curious about the Reaſon, as obſervant of the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This ſeems to be the caſe of the Chriſtians of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he himſelf appear to have been very curious in that matter.<note place="margin">Sec Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">§. II.

                        </note> ſome convenient time before; that a ſuitable Preparation might be made againſt that ſolemn Feaſt, to which every Iſraelite was bound to repair.</p>
                     <p>Notice the Jews wanted, that liv'd at any diſtance from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to order their affairs ſo, that their abſence for ſome Weeks at that time from home,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46380:213"/>might be leſs incommodious: however to make ready any reſidue of Holy things, that might be in their hands, and were to be ſpent at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to take care to have all their Family cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd; to Purify themſelves, if not to take up the Lamb; to diſcharge the Vow of a Nazarite, if they had any ſuch upon them; to provide, and to offer, any Euchariſtical Sacrifice, that might be due. And for ſome of theſe reaſons, they commonly came up to the Temple before the Feaſt; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Week had its peculiar Celebrity: and probably all the fourteen days of that Firſt Month were half Feſtival, as hath been intimated above<note n="(e)" place="margin">Part 1. Ch. 5. §. 3.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuch a notice was likewiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the <hi>Ante-Paſchal Preparation,</hi> the Chriſtians us'd, though in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary manner. For they, as we have ſeen<note n="(f)" place="margin">Part 1. Ch. 3.</note>, ſpent ſome time before in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; all of them, both the Aſiaticks, and thoſe who differ'd from them: and though ſome <hi>faſted</hi> only <hi>one day,</hi> yet <hi>others</hi> faſted <hi>two, others more,</hi> ſays <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus;</hi> and of them, <hi>ſome Forty.</hi> This indeed is the account <hi>Irenaeus</hi> gives of his own, and <hi>Victor</hi>'s ſide: but, in all
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46380:213"/>probability, the Aſiatick manner of Faſting, differ'd not from theirs in length of time. For from that <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Conſtitution,</hi> cited by the <hi>Audaeans,</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> it has appear'd not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely <hi>(e),</hi> that thoſe alſo of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> manner, oppoſing their Faſts to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivity of the Jews, began therefore their Faſting at leaſt a Week, if not a Fortnight before the 14th day: as the ſame Oppoſition might have directed them, to have kept the 50 days after with great Joy.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. But in this contrary manner of obſerving the Antepaſchal Seaſon, Oppoſition to the Jews was not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deſign'd: neither was it further proſecuted by the Chriſtians, than they were lead to it by contrary Cauſes. For what ever reaſon the Jews might have for their Pentecoſtal Sadneſs, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt gave his Followers a greater, for Joy: and if the Jews did exult in the Death of their Meſſiah, the Chriſtians were certainly to lament it. This Lamentation alſo of our Saviour's Death, as it was not made in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any loſs by them ſuſtain'd;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46380:214"/>ſo neither did it ariſe out of Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt his Mortal Perſecutors.</p>
                     <p>On his Paſſion-Day they Faſted, and Griev'd for the Sin of the Jews, by which he was put to Death: but they bemoaned alſo their other Sins, and the Sins of the whole World, and more eſpecially their own; thoſe for which he ſuffer'd, and which were all the more guilty, and more hateful cauſes of his Crucifixion. In this Abhorrence of all Sin, and Penitential Grief, they ſpent the day of their Lord's Death: and for the better performing this Duty then, they prepar'd themſelves, by the Abſtinence and Devotions of the Seaſon before.</p>
                     <p>This was the Intention, as well as Practice, of the whole Church; and this was their <hi>Antepaſchal Preparation,</hi> concurring at leaſt in time with that of the Jews. But the Chriſtians, agreed yet nearer with the Jews in this whole Action; paſſing their time, not indeed as the Jews then did in that very Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but as they did in another as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and in an occaſion wholly alike to the preſent circumſtances of the Chriſtians: that is the Church of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46380:214"/>Chriſt kept the <hi>Day of the Paſſion,</hi> as the Jews did the <hi>Day of Expiation;</hi> and prepar'd for the one, juſt after the ſame manner as They did for the other.</p>
                     <p>For this is the Conjecture I now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that as many Jewiſh Ordinancies were patterns to the Chriſtians, and as their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Munday,</hi> and <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> were remov'd to our <hi>Sunday,</hi> and <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and <hi>Friday;</hi> ſo their <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Day,</hi> was transfer'd to our <hi>Paſſion Day;</hi> accompanied, as it us'd to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, with all its Praevious Offices. And this Parallel, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> we may remember, in the name of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, has already ſuggeſted to us<note n="(g)" place="margin">Part 1.

                     <p>Now that they might be ſure not to be defective in ſo neceſſary a Duty; they took care to begin the Office of that Day, earlier than the Sunſet of the firſt Evening; and to conclude it later than that of the ſecond.

After Noon they begin the Service of the Evening, continuing their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till the Sun is ready to ſet; when they ſubjoin another Office, for the Cloſe of the Day, and peculiar to that day: and then when the Night of the next day is come; they have the ſolemn Bleſſing pronounc'd by the Prieſts that are preſent, and ſo are diſmiſs'd:</p>
                     <p>After this manner, while the <hi>Temple</hi> ſtood, the Jews heretofore are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to have employ'd the Day of Expiation; and not otherwiſe to have

                     <p>And ſince the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of their <hi>Temple,</hi> and ceaſing of their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> this their own Office the Jews ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; and impute ſo much to their due performance of it, as to think<note n="(d)" place="margin">Rep. 1.

                     <p n="2">§. II. NOW as it is certain, what was laid down in the Chapter forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>Day</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> was the Great and Laſt <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation;</hi> when that one <hi>Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> was made for the Sins of the <hi>whole World,</hi> and of <hi>all Ages,</hi> by that our Great and <hi>Catholick High Prieſt</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Tert. adv. Marc. <hi>49.</hi>
                        </note>: ſo is it not to be queſtion'd, but that the whole World, had it then known what Propitiation our Bleſſed Lord was making for them, would have join'd the Affliction of their own Souls, with that his bitter Paſſion; and would, in
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46380:222"/>their ſeveral Habitations, have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied his Oblation for their Sins, with their own Confeſſion of them; with bitter grief for their Commiſſion, and ſtrong and earneſt Supplication for their Pardon.</p>
                     <p>This All <hi>Mankind</hi> could not have fail'd to have done on that Day; had they but known, what our <hi>Saviour</hi> was then doing for them. But that then was hid, from the Eyes of the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of his Death came to be reveal'd, and the Propitiation of that day was made known; if his Diſciples thought fit to keep an <hi>annual Memorial</hi> of it, (and that duty the <hi>Paſchal Seaſon</hi> of the Jews, ſo ſolemnly kept, could not but ſuggeſt to Chriſtians;) they could not neither fail of Solemnizing the <hi>return</hi> of that Day, with that Profound Veneration of our Suffering Lord, and that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Supplicatory Devotion to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which the <hi>Original</hi> Day it ſelf would have requir'd from them.</p>
                     <p>Now that ſuch a Day was kept yearly, in memory of the Paſſion of our Lord, in the firſt and Apoſtolical Age;
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46380:222"/>is a truth, which the former Part of this Diſcourſe may have clear'd to us<note n="(f)" place="margin">Part 1. Chap. 3.</note>: and that it was all along obſerv'd, with as great a ſtrictneſs of Faſting and Humiliation, as the Jews themſelves us'd on their day of Propitiation; is likewiſe manifeſt: as it is alſo moſt certain, that the Grief, and Affliction, they then were under, was not for the Death and Loſs of their Lord, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but for the Guilt of their Sins, and the Sins of the World, for which their Lord and Maſter had that day ſuffer'd. So much correſpondence there was, moſt evidently, between the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Jews, and of the Chriſtians, on their two Great Faſt Days.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhould our Saviour's Expiatory Sacrifice, which completed and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded the Jewiſh, have been attended anſwerably: and thus actually was the Annually Memory of it, afterwards celebrated with a ſuitable Devotion. And this, though not done by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, in vertue of any ſuch ſtrict Injunction, as that under the Old Covenant; might yet be well taken up, upon the cogent reaſon of ſo juſt a Congruity. And as the <hi>Jews</hi> continue
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46380:223"/>their <hi>Devotional</hi> Office, now when by the Judgment of God an end is put to the <hi>Sacrificial:</hi> ſo might the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> think fit to keep up a yearly <hi>memory</hi> of that their <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> whoſe offering was once made, and never to be reiterated, but its efficacy is to endure for ever: they likewiſe obſerving this Solemnity, not with any Ritual Form, but with ſuch eternal Duties of Penitence and Supplication, as are always incumbent upon us miſerable Sinners, which the Juſtice of God will perpetually require, and his Goodneſs in our Saviour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. THERE ſeems therefore to be reaſon enough, from the nature of the Thing: from that Myſterious Suffering of our Lord, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Practiſe of his Primitive Servants; to found the continued Solemnity of the Paſſion Day, upon its correſpondence with the Levitical Day of Propitiation. Neither is it to be expected that I ſhould juſtify the Parallel, by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any like Opinion of the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to that we have ſeen of the Jews, concerning the Neceſſity and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46380:223"/>Merit of the Obſervation of the Day: when the one was obſerv'd only as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Expedient, (though in the <hi>judgment</hi> probably of thoſe who had <hi>the Spirit of God</hi>); and the other as Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively commanded by God <hi>Himſelf.</hi> And yet ſo far did the firſt Chriſtians ſeem to regard the vertue of a Jewiſh Expiation Day, in their Practiſe about their own, that they ſtill determin'd the ordinary ſtated <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of ejected Brethren, with the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Good Friday,</hi> and the following <hi>Saturday,</hi> (both which were the Days of our Lord's Paſſion;) as if by that their Converſion was conſummated, and the Pardon of the Church intirely gain'd.</p>
                     <p>And when they readmitted <hi>Penitents</hi> on <hi>Maundy Thurſday;</hi> as was the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Uſage of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and it may be of all others; they did not therefore depart from this their Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with the Expiation Day, but rather confirm'd it. For the <hi>Jews,</hi> as we have ſeen<note n="(g)" place="margin">Rep. 1. Ch. 5. §. 3.</note>, on the <hi>Eve</hi> of their <hi>Expiation relax</hi> their Sentences of <hi>Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and admit all to the Office of the next Day: and for the ſame reaſon the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46380:224"/>Chriſtians might admit their Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates, to the Offices of both Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Days; and even thoſe, whom they did not afterwards ſuffer to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their Communion. The office of the Paſſion Day, or Days, I mean; which conſiſted in Confeſſion, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: for it is very probable, that in the earlier times the Reconcil'd Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were not admitted to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lord's Body and Blood, until <hi>Eaſter-Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Supper</hi> likewiſe, which was us'd to be held ſolemnly on that <hi>Thurſday,</hi> though it is ſaid to be in Imitation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our Lord's Supper; yet it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have proceeded from the Practiſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> on their <hi>Expiation Eve,</hi> which we mention'd above. For they, in the Concluſion of their Penitential Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration towards the Propitiation Day, do always make a <hi>Solemn Supper:</hi> and think it as much their Duty to eat well on that Evening, as on the Sabbath: that being, in their Opinion, a Duty of the Afternoon; as ſtrict Faſting, is the Duty of the following Day.</p>
                     <p>So agreeable was the Supper of <hi>Paſſion Thurſday,</hi> to the Supper of the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46380:224"/>Jews on the Eve of their Expiation: and more agreeable, than to the laſt Supper of our Bleſſed Lord; which, (if we go by Jewiſh Cuſtom,) was held after Night; and, in their reckoning therefore, rather on the <hi>Friday,</hi> than on the <hi>Thurſday:</hi> Agreeable I ſay as to the time; for as to the Freedom of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſuppoſe it differ'd much from that Jewiſh Meal.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe <hi>Aſiaticks</hi>

                        </note> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were, and which many other Churches have alſo embrac'd, that our Saviour ſuffer'd on the 15th day of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan:</hi> neither is it likely, that they did not Faſt on that day; notwithſtanding they are ſaid to have broke it off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for ſuch a neglect, no doubt, could not have been paſs'd over unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46380:225"/>by their Adverſaries, and would have drawn upon them the cenſure of <hi>Victor,</hi> more than either of the other differences; and beſides, we know, their now mention'd Followers did actually ſo faſt <hi>(i).</hi> I ſuppoſe therefore that their Breaking off the Faſt, was not a Determination of it, but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption by ſuch a <hi>Supper;</hi> and that this their Meal was Formal, and Full; and in the nature of a Feaſt, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: whereas the Supper, if any, of the reſt of the Chriſtians was a ſparing refreſhment; and ſuch as, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the other Meal, did not ſeem to Diſcontinue the Abſtinence of the Seaſon; as ſince it has not been thought to do.</p>
                     <p>To theſe leſſer particulars, by which ſome indications of a Propitiation Day may appear; I ſhall laſtly add another Cuſtom, to be read in the <hi>Ordo Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> their cuſtom of ſtriking of Fire, and <hi>lighting up</hi> their <hi>Candles</hi> very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, in the Evening of the ſame <hi>Paſſion Thurſday.</hi> For, whatever other reaſon it may have had for its inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it does alſo very well correſpond with the Uſage of the <hi>Jews;</hi> who take,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46380:225"/>as we have obſerv'd, very particular care to have their <hi>Candles</hi> ready againſt their <hi>Propitiation Eve,</hi> with which that night their <hi>Synagogues</hi> are more than ordinarily enlightned.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have offer'd to ſhew the Reſemblance, our Paſſion-Day bears to the Jew's Expiation Day; both in it ſelf, and ſome Rites of the Day immediately preceeding it.

                     <p n="2">§. II.

                     <p>But, to return to my ſubject; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the fortune of this laſt Conjecture may be; the Reader, I hope, will not be unwilling to allow, that <hi>Forty days</hi> might have been always with the Jews a <hi>Penitential ſpace</hi> of time; that it is ſo look'd upon by them now, and has been time out of Mind; and that the Forty Days, ending in the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46380:230"/>Day of <hi>Expiation,</hi> are of the ſame nature.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. AND now I come to trace the <hi>Parallel:</hi> which yet the Reader muſt have been drawing to himſelf before. For if we do but conſider their <hi>Propitiation Day,</hi> as the Great commanded Faſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the <hi>Seven,</hi> or nine before it, as days ſometime after generally agreed on, to <hi>prepare</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe for That; and alſo ſome <hi>other Days,</hi> afterwards <hi>added</hi> to thoſe, for the ſame purpoſe, by the Devotion of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, but in a <hi>various number,</hi> at the Diſcretion of ſeveral Perſons and Places; and all theſe ſeverally added out of the <hi>Forty,</hi> which are to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd backwards from the Radical Faſt, and which comprehended a <hi>ſolemn ſpace</hi> of <hi>Penitential Time;</hi> This, I ſay, if we do but recollect; we cannot at the ſame time but think, that we have here an exact Pattern of our <hi>Chriſtian Lent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For when the <hi>Paſſion Day</hi> was once put for our <hi>Expiation Day;</hi> as indeed ſuch it was, and I preſume in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was ſo eſteem'd univerſally; ſome Few <hi>days before</hi> it were then judg'd
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46380:230"/>fit to be taken in for a <hi>Preparation</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Part 1.

At the ſame time, to theſe <hi>Others</hi> were alſo <hi>added,</hi> but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionally, as ſeveral Perſons thought fit, and ſeveral Churches directed; and ſo many added by ſome, as to make up the number <hi>Forty:</hi> a number of Days, that was always look'd upon as the moſt <hi>ſolemn for a Faſt;</hi> which thoſe therefore <hi>reckon'd,</hi> who did not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>keep</hi> them; and which gave <hi>Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> conſequently, even to the Leſſer Spaces, that were faſted within them<note n="(c)" place="margin">— Ch. 10.</note>.</p>
                     <p>That is, I ſuppoſe the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> as ſoon as it came to be obſerv'd Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, to have anſwer'd the <hi>Seven,</hi> or <hi>Ten Days of the Jews.</hi> For it was not neceſſary, that the Days ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely of the ſame Number, though they were of the ſame Nature: for that the Particular conſiderations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity might otherwiſe determine; as when they reſolv'd to keep the Paſſion Day, not upon the day of the <hi>Month,</hi> but of the <hi>Week.</hi> That <hi>Paſſion Week</hi>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:46380:231"/>therefore was kept with more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtrictneſs of Penitential Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if the <hi>Sunday</hi> of it was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted</hi> from Faſting, it was becauſe it had with us the privilege of a Sabbath; for the <hi>Jews</hi> faſt not their <hi>Sabbath of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence.</hi> As there was too another appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conformity between the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians,</hi> in the obſervation of the <hi>Holy Saturday:</hi> for whereas thoſe Chriſtians never faſted on any <hi>Saturday</hi> or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> no more than the Jews; yet on the <hi>Paſſion Saturday</hi> they always <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;</hi> as the Jews do likewiſe on that ſingle <hi>Sabbath,</hi> upon which their <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Day</hi> may fall.</p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>Holy Week,</hi> which, with the following <hi>Feſtival</hi> one, was a time of <hi>Vacation</hi> in <hi>Courts of Justice,</hi> by the Imperial Law<note n="(d)" place="margin">Part 1. Ch. 5. §. 3.</note>, under the Chriſtian Emperours; and might have had the ſame immunity before, by Private Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Church; was in this too not unlike to that Penitential time of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in which they Hear no <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> nor adminiſter any <hi>Oaths</hi>

                        </note>. And it is obſervable that when a <hi>Larger Lent</hi> came to be formally kept; as that of Forty days was; at leaſt, after the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46380:231"/>Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> either by the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or Agreement of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church: that then in a little time the ſame <hi>Vacation</hi> was enlarg'd too; and it became unlawful to give any <hi>Oaths,</hi> during the whole <hi>Quadrageſimal</hi> Seaſon; A Privilege that was after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to other times of Publick Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo of Feſtivity.</p>
                     <p>Such is the Correſpondence between the <hi>Antepaſchal Faſt</hi> of the Chriſtians, and the <hi>Ante Propitiation Faſt</hi> of the Jews: and by that, if I miſtake not, a good and rational Account is given of the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Antient Church:</hi> why they firſt choſe to keep ſuch a <hi>Faſt</hi> in general, and yet notwithſtanding <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd</hi> in the Particular of its length; every Church, if not Perſon, being left to their liberty therein: why one Portion of its time, the <hi>Paſſion Week,</hi> came in a little while to be commonly obſerv'd, and reputed more <hi>Holy:</hi> as alſo, why all the while there was ſuch a Regard to <hi>Forty Days;</hi> as that ſome faſted them in the Beginning; others afterwards us'd their <hi>Name;</hi> and all in ſome time endeavour'd to come as near the <hi>Number</hi> on either hand, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition

A Very great Reſemblance, if I miſtake not, has appear'd between the Chriſtian Faſt of <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> and the Jewiſh of their <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation Day;</hi> in the Ground, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of the Obſervation; in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Abſtinence; and in the other Penitential Duties. And likewiſe no leſs Similitude has been diſcover'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the reſpective <hi>Preparatory Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> in their Reaſon alſo, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the ſpace of Time.</p>
                     <p>And this ſo near a Reſemblance might of it ſelf have perſwaded us, that it could not have ariſen by chance;
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:46380:233"/>and that if both the Pieces were not Copies, the one was Drawn by the other: and it would have been as plain alſo in ordinary preſumption, if one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation muſt have been the Copy; that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> was the <hi>Original.</hi> But all this grows more undeniable, when we come to reflect, that our Church it ſelf was deriv'd from Theirs; and moſt of its Offices, Diſcipline, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, borrowed thence. For why ſhould not their <hi>Expiation Day,</hi> be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by our <hi>Paſſion Day;</hi> when our <hi>Sundays,</hi> and <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> and the old <hi>Stationary</hi> Days, our <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and our <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> are all after the like Example? And if we have followed the Jews, in their Methods of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> and ways of <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> why not in the Solemnity of a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for ſuch Duties?</p>
                     <p>And now if this Derivation I have propos'd, might be taken for granted; I might then obſerve againſt the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Socinus,</hi> that an Anniverſary, and very Remarkable Teſtimony has been all along given, by the whole Church of God, to the Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our Bleſſed Lord: as poſſibly
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:46380:233"/>the Diſcontinuance of that antient and laudable Practice, may have given too much way to the late Revival, and Modern Increaſe, of that Great Error in Belief. But I will not offer to found a Truth ſo Sacred, and which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo well grounded, upon any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, however Probable it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. II. But, though I do not after all affirm poſitively, that the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had this Correſpondence in their View, at the Inſtitution of that Holy Time; for I ſhall leave it as Probable only, and to the Judgment of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For our Saviour's Paſſion, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, and of all Ages; was indeed once offer'd in the fullneſs of time and by Him never to be Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but eternally therefore to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated;
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:46380:234"/>by the Believing Redeem'd part of Mankind, in all their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come. And if the Reſurrection of our Lord, was always thought fit to be recognis'd with a Weekly, and therefore certainly with an Annual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity: his Death alſo, as ſurely as it was fixt in Time, and known to have come to paſs the <hi>Friday</hi> before; ſo as neceſſarily did it demand its Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo, if not Weekly, Memorial. For, though his Reſurrection, indeed, was exceedingly Glorious and Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; yet his Paſſion was, no doubt, much the more Mighty, and more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, Work: in as much, as the Death of the Eternal Son of God, was far more Wondrous than his Riſing from it; and it was yet more Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he ſhould ſubmit to the Inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Condeſcenſion for our ſakes. For the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his Paſſion; it was, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> tells us, that <hi>he came into the World</hi>

                     <p>Had we therefore no conſtant Need of this Expiation of our Lord, for our repeated continual Tranſgreſſions; and had we been abſolutely Innocent, ever ſince our firſt Regeneration by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: yet the <hi>Death,</hi> in which we were Baptis'd, and by which we had been once Redeem'd, could not have fail'd of a pious and grateful <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, once</hi> at leaſt in the <hi>Year;</hi> and this <hi>Day,</hi> if any other, would have had its place in the Chriſtian <hi>Calendar.</hi>

But though our Interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Offences have neceſſarily chang'd the manner of the Celebration, and turn'd our Joy into Mourning; yet the Commemoration it ſelf is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſeded by them, and is rather inforc'd by greater reaſon; for we are now to be call'd to the Remembrance
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46380:235"/>of our Sins, as well as of our Lord's Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>And if we now countercharge the Suppoſition; and as before we regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the Death of our Lord, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly from our Sins after Baptiſm; ſo here we regard thoſe only, and take no notice of any Anniverſary of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet even the <hi>ſeparate conſideration</hi> of thoſe <hi>Sins,</hi> might well have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd to them ſome <hi>One Day</hi> in the <hi>Year;</hi> wherein, after an extraordinary manner, we ſhould confeſs and lament their guilt, humbly beſeech their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and intreat the Benefit of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for them. For, though the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for Sin have ceas'd, by that one Propitiation of Our Saviour; yet by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Experience we know, that our Sins ceaſe not: they are generally as numerous and frequent, as they were before the Covenant; and much more heinous, having now become exceeding Sinful, as committed againſt greater Light, and higher Obligations. If therefore we will underſtand our ſelves aright, <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> continue to be the daily Duty of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as well as of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:46380:235"/>
                        <hi>Jews;</hi> make a no leſs Proper, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Part of our ordinary Publick Devotions; and are ſtill as fit to be the expreſs Buſineſs, and peculiar Office, of ſome Extraordinary Time. And if ſuch an Appointment ſhould be made, by the Governours of the Church, that we ſhould meet together for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>annually</hi> on a <hi>ſolemn Day,</hi> to take the more publick Shame to our ſelves, and to give the greater Glory to God; no Good Chriſtian, ſure, would refuſe to concur in ſo common, and neceſſary, a Work: but as he is ready to meet and celebrate any other <hi>Faſt,</hi> indicted on the occaſion of Temporary Calamities; ſo he would never decline to join in a <hi>Humiliation,</hi> aſſign'd for much more weighty ſpiritual reaſons, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Immortal Souls, and averting of Eternal Vengeance. He only that is <hi>without Sin,</hi> might ſeem unconcern'd in ſuch an Order: but he then would not not be without Charity; and would be, in this alſo; like our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that he would condeſcend to humble himſelf for the Sins of his Brethren.</p>
                     <p>And were there now ſuch a General, and Solemn, <hi>Chriſtian Faſt</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46380:236"/>and were we to find it a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon:</hi> it could not undoubtedly be more congruouſly plac'd in the whole Circle of the Year, than on the <hi>Day</hi> of our Lord's <hi>Paſſion;</hi> were there any ſuch day already obſerv'd. For, as all the Refuge of our Supplications, muſt be in that Expiation; and by it only, God can be intreated: ſo a lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that Death, would beſt give us the due ſence of the Guilt and Demerit of all Sins; but moſt bitterly reproach us with our own, thoſe Bold and Ungrateful Tranſgreſſions of a moſt Gracious Covenant, that was ſeal'd in ſuch Precious Blood.</p>
                     <p>So fitly, and naturally, do <hi>both</hi> thoſe <hi>Duties,</hi> of Celebrating the <hi>Memory</hi> of our <hi>Lord's Death,</hi> and <hi>Mourning</hi> for our own <hi>Sins,</hi> concur on the <hi>ſame Day:</hi> the Recognition of that our Expiation, and the Affliction of our Souls, being as cloſely join'd together by Eternal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as ever they were by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> the Duties alſo heightning each other; our Humiliation increas'd, by the conſideration of our Saviour's; and the Mercy of his Expiation more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Ador'd, in the conſideration of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:46380:236"/>thoſe Sins, whoſe Pardon we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore.</p>
                     <p>For that <hi>Double Reaſon,</hi> and with this <hi>Double Duty,</hi> has <hi>Good Friday</hi> been always obſerv'd: Nor will the Devout Practice be blam'd by any Regular Church, or Chriſtian. Regular, I ſay; not ſpeaking of thoſe, who will not keep the Day, becauſe the Papiſts do; for by the ſame reaſon they may refuſe to keep <hi>Sunday:</hi> or becauſe it is injoin'd, to the Prejudice, they ſay, of their Chriſtian Liberty; for ſo they may refuſe to yield to an Argument, becauſe it convinces them.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. III. NOW theſe two Great Duties, when they are once fix'd upon their proper Day, which they will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imploy; will alſo require, that we ſhould come in ſome meaſure <hi>Fit</hi> for ſo weighty an Office; and ſhould be <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,</hi> in a more than Ordinary manner, for the Extraordinary Performance.</p>
                     <p>For, (according to the Suppoſition I now us'd) were we to celebrate the Anniverſary of our <hi>Lord's Paſſion</hi> only, and with no reſpect to our Sins ſince our Baptiſm: yet we ſhould come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:46380:237"/>the ſolemn Day too Raſhly, and Unworthily, if we did not appoint ſome others to go before it, and uſher it in; and ſhould ſeem to have too low thoughts of the ſacred Myſtery, if we did not take care to riſe up to the high Conſideration, by the ſteps and aſcents of ſome previous Meditations. To the keeping of the Great Memorial rightly, ſuch Preparatory Remembrances would be wanting: that we may bring to it a fuller, and livelier Perception of the <hi>Mercies of God in Chriſt;</hi> may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comprehend, <hi>with all Saints,</hi> the Dimenſions of that <hi>ſurpaſſing,</hi> ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Love;</hi> may more profoundly Adore, more gratefully Thank, and more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly Devote our ſelves and our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; having before-hand endeavour'd to Confirm and Actuate our Faith, to Raiſe and Quicken our Hope, and to Oblige and Inflame our Charity.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch a Preparatory Seaſon is ſtill more needful for the other, the <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential,</hi> part: that we ſhould afore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to Recollect our paſt Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to Reflect upon their Guilt, and to diſpoſe our Minds to an Abhorrence of them; that we ſhould beſeech God
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:46380:237"/>humbly for his Grace, to promote this Holy Work; ſhould review our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, bewail its Breaches, and Repair them, by Confeſſion to God, and Reſtitution to Men; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our Vows, and Mortifying our Luſts, and recovering and improving our virtuous Habits; againſt that <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> when we are ſolemnly to appear in the Divine Preſence, Contrite and truly ſorrowful for our Sins, ſtedfaſtly reſolv'd to Forſake them, and, as much as in us lies, Qualified for their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                     <p>Thus would a <hi>Preparation</hi> have been Neceſſary, to <hi>either</hi> of thoſe Two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Apart:</hi> but much more juſtly will they expect it, when <hi>join'd together;</hi> when we are to be Provided, both fitly to Contemplate the Myſtery, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to be Benefited by its Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>For theſe Holy, and Important, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <hi>Lent</hi> is inſtituted: a ſolemn, and large, ſpace of time; to be Religiouſly imploy'd by each private Chriſtian, at his Diſcretion; as the condition of his Soul ſhall require, and the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Worldly Affairs permit. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:46380:238"/>the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of it gives Warning of the, then diſtant, Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation Day; and calls us early to our Duty: actually entring us on the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Work, by Reflection on our Sins, and Acknowledgment of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; by Faſting, and Prayer: and engaging us to go on, and to make uſe of the following Intermediate Seaſon; for the perfecting our Repentance; and for our Increaſe in the Knowledge of the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>Wiſdom and Power of God.</hi> A notice very neceſſary, to thoſe who want a ſolemn Monitor; and which, by the Grace of God, may ſome time or other ſerve to Awaken, and Reclaim them: but always Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and Welcome, to the Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; who, the more ſenſible he is of his own Offences, and of the Mercy of God in Chriſt, the more ready he will be to comply with the Advice, and the more glad of the occaſion. Some days therefore, of thoſe many that follow, are preſum'd to be ſet apart for ſuch Preparatory Thoughts, and Actions; <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> we may ſuppoſe, and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> thoſe Weekly Paſſion Days: when alſo, Opportunities of Publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:46380:238"/>are every where preſented; and, in our Great City, Exhortations like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and Inſtructions are adminiſter'd, by the Wife and Pious Order of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> But the <hi>laſt Week,</hi> is more particularly Dedicated to this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and then the Church expects its devout Members daily to appear before God together; to meditate on the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Lord, and with Penitent Hearts, and earneſt Reſolutions of <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe unto Sin,</hi> to Attend thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth upon him to his Croſs, and wait till his Reſurrection: and alſo Directs us, to paſs the time, not in ſuch Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Auſterities, as unprofitably afflict the Body; but in ſuch an Abſtinence from divertive Pleaſures, and even from common Liberties of Food, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of Buſineſs, as may ſpeak our Thoughts and Affections to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imploy'd, and, freeing them from Avocation and Diſtraction, may Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and Improve them.</p>
                     <p>By this Orderly and Natural Method, we are deſign'd to be brought at laſt to the Memorial of our Expiation, with ſuch a ſence of our Sins, and of the Mercy of our Suffering Saviour; as
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:46380:239"/>may procure from God the Pardon of what is Paſt, and his Grace and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the Future: that the <hi>following, Years</hi> may have reaſon to bleſs thoſe <hi>Forty Days:</hi> and ſtill ſucceſſively ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, may every <hi>Lent</hi> find Fewer, and Lighter Sins to Confeſs; and be ſtill more ready to Lament them.</p>
                     <p>This is the Innocent, and Godly, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of that Time; which thoſe of us who Underſtand, will certainly Commend; and thoſe who Commend, ſhould take care to Purſue.</p>
